The trial was told Mrs King's severe dementia had worsened in the months before her death and her husband had Alzheimer's and another mental health condition called paraphrenia which affected his ability to form judgements.
King, of Cedar Close, Walton-on-the-Naze, denied murder at an earlier hearing, but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
During the trial, the jury heard King also considered shooting his older sister Eileen, who is a resident at the care home, as well as himself.
Mr King was sentenced to six years for manslaughter, five years for firearm possession and 12 months for possessing ammunition. All three terms will be served concurrently.
The judge ordered he be treated for his mental health condition at a secure hospital unit in Northampton.
Consultant psychiatrist James Warner said paraphrenia was an older person's version of schizophrenia in which people lose contact with reality.",An 87-year-old man who shot his wife dead at a care home has been sentenced to six years in prison.
"Scottish winger Matt Williams' early touchdown caused shudders round a soaking wet Sixways.
But the home side responded with four tries, allied to 18 points from the boot of stand-off Ryan Lamb.
Flanker Sam Lewis scored a hat-trick of tries, while winger Dean Hammond also crossed the whitewash.
Lamb kicked three of his four conversion attempts, as well as two key first-half penalties - and two more late in the game.
Full-back Peter Lydon got the Exiles' other try, which he converted, along with a first-half penalty for a 10-point haul.
Scottish trailed by five points from Saturday's first leg, only for that advantage to be wiped out inside the first six minutes.
Jamie Stevenson's blindside run set up right wing Williams to score in the corner.
But that turned out to be the nearest this contest got to a Scottish gain as Warriors eventually rallied and started to tick the right boxes.
Two Lamb penalties in the space of three minutes were followed by a Sam Lewis pushover try in the left corner, from which Lamb was also successful with the conversion.
Peter Lydon did reduce the deficit at the interval to 13-8 with a penalty, but two tries in four minutes at the start of the second half killed the contest.
All Blacks winger Cooper Vuna, switched to full-back following an early injury to Ben Howard, set up Hammond, converted by Lamb before Lewis crashed over in the right corner, from which Lamb missed his first kick of the night.
Lydon converted his own try to bring it back to 25-15 on the night, before Lewis's third try, again converted by Lamb.
Lamb landed two more penalties before injury-weakened Warriors brought the biggest roar of the night with the late introduction of 17-year-old schoolboy Jamie Shillcock at scrum-half.

"Joe Lawton, 17, shot himself at his family farm in Greater Manchester two days after his arrest.
His parents, Nick and Jane Lawton, are urging the Government to change the law, which says 17 year-olds are not children in custody.
The Home Office believes current laws are adequate.
Joe was arrested when police stopped him as he drove his new car home from a party last August.
He was kept overnight at Cheadle Heath police station in Greater Manchester without his parents' knowledge because he was not classed as a child.
Two days later he took his own life, using a shotgun from the family farm. The police charge sheet was at his feet when his father found him.
Joe's parents believe they could have given him more support had they been able to see him in a police cell.
In a statement on the change.org website, Mr and Mrs Lawton said: ""He was just 17 and had made a bad decision to drive home after a party. Two days later Joe took his own life.
""We were not called when he was arrested or given the opportunity to give him the support he needed.""
They added: ""The fact that a 17-year-old is treated as an adult whilst in custody is an anomaly of British law.  Once they are charged they are then treated as children. This simply does not make sense.""
""We believe if the law had been different Joe would still be alive.""
A Home Office spokesman said: ""We believe the laws in place ensure the appropriate level of care for everyone, including 17-year-olds.""",The parents of a boy who killed himself after being arrested for drink-driving arrest are calling for 17-year-olds to be treated as children in custody.

"It said such a move would ""reduce the burden"" on passengers who could instead go to claims companies which would take a cut of any payouts.
Hundreds of flights were grounded by last Saturday's IT problems.
BA said that it had ""no desire to be obstructive"" and would fully honour its compensation obligations.
The problems, which continued throughout last weekend, disrupted the travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers around the world.
Under EU law, passengers can claim compensation from BA for travel disruption, worth up to 600 euros (Â£524).
They can also claim expenses for items such as hotels, meals and phone calls - a matter that led to a dispute with insurers during the week.
Which? said the airline sector was out of step with other service industries.
In a letter to BA chief executive Alex Cruz, Alex Neill from Which? wrote: ""You have 'profusely' apologised to passengers, many of whom have had their holidays ruined, and have 'committed' to following the rules on compensation.
""This does not go far enough and is simply not good enough. You have failed your customers once and are in grave danger of doing it again.
""By simplifying the compensation process, you have an opportunity to minimise the additional stress and inconvenience you cause your customers and ensure they are not pushed into the arms of claims management companies, who will take a large part of the money they are owed.
""British Airways can, and should, seek to automatically issue statutory compensation to all affected passengers.
""This would reduce the burden on passengers and mean they get back what they are legally entitled to quicker.
""It would also allow you to focus on dealing with the individual additional expenses incurred by affected passengers on a case-by-case basis.
""Disruptions like last weekend only highlight that it is time for all airlines to introduce measures so that, where possible, passengers are compensated automatically for delays and cancellations.""
A BA spokeswoman said: ""We sincerely apologise for the difficulties and frustration customers faced during the huge disruption across the bank holiday weekend.
""We will fully honour our EU compensation obligations and have set up a link on the home page of our website to enable customers to submit their claims as quickly and conveniently as possible.
""We have no desire to be obstructive in any way and have put additional resources into our call centres to process claims as speedily as possible.""
According to one comparison website, an estimated 70% of all airline customers who have a right to a payout do not claim.
Virgin became the first rail company to automatically compensate some train passengers if they are delayed.
Travellers using its services on the West Coast main line - and who book their tickets via the company app or website - receive automatic repayments.
Communications regulator Ofcom is also investigating the use of automatic compensation when phone or internet services fail.
At present, customers tend to go through one of two ombudsman services.","British Airways should automatically compensate thousands of customers who were caught up in disruption last weekend, says consumer group Which?"
"Recep Tayyip Erdogan said voters had chosen stability following unrest.
With almost all ballots counted, state-run Anadolu news agency said the AKP had won 49.4% of the vote, with the main opposition CHP on 25.4%.
European observers have criticised the government for stifling media freedom.
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said violence, especially in the country's south-east, had also had a significant impact on the election.
Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) went further and denounced the entire process as ""unfair"".
President Erdogan hailed the result early on Monday, saying: ""The national will manifested itself on 1 November in favour of stability.""
But he also attacked media criticism of him and called for global recognition of the election result.
""Now a party with some 50% [of the vote] in Turkey has attained power... This should be respected by the whole world, but I have not seen such maturity.""

Lira strengthens after result
Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu will now begin the process of forming a new government.
Mr Erdogan called the second general election this year after his AKP lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in 13 years in June and attempts to form a coalition failed.
The pro-Kurdish HDP crossed the 10% threshold needed to claim seats in parliament, but it got 21 fewer MPs than in June's election.
The nationalist MHP's share of the vote also declined, to 11.9%, and commentators suggested it had lost voters to the AKP.
Reported results also showed:
Clashes were reported in the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, in the south-east of Turkey, as the results were being counted. Reuters said police had fired tear gas at protesters throwing stones.
Since elections in June, a ceasefire between the Turkish army and militants from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has collapsed.
Critics have accused Mr Erdogan of renewing violence to curb support for the HDP - something the government denies.
In a statement on Monday, Ignacio Sanchez Amor, head of the OSCE observer mission, said: ""Physical attacks on party members, as well as the significant security concerns, particularly in the south-east... imposed restrictions on the ability to campaign.""
He added that pressure on journalists - including a police raid on the Koza-Ipek media group in Istanbul last week - was a major concern.
Meanwhile Andreas Gross, head of the PACE delegation, said: ""Unfortunately, the campaign for these elections was characterised by unfairness and, to a serious degree, fear.""
HDP co-chair Selahattin Demirtas said on Sunday that it had not been ""a fair or equal election"".
The party suspended campaigning after a bombing in Ankara last month killed more than 100 people. The government said the attackers were linked to the Islamic State (IS) group.
Violence has escalated in Turkey since a suicide bombing in July by suspected IS militants.
The attack near the border with Syria killed more than 30 Kurds.
Turkish newspaper front pages reflect the contrasting euphoria and gloom from government supporters and opponents at the election result.

"The England striker, 23, came through United's famed youth system but joined the Gunners for £16m on deadline day.
United brought striker Radamel Falcao on a £6m loan deal from Monaco, their sixth signing of the transfer window.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""They have probably lost the way of Manchester United a little bit,"" Phelan told BBC Sport.
""Now, rather than produce, it may be the case where they are buying in.
""Someone like a Danny Welbeck has been part of United's identity and that has been broken.
""What will happen in the future now, nobody knows but that thread has been broken now.""
Former United midfielder David Beckham said he was sad to see Welbeck leave, but is hopeful promising players will continue to be developed under new manager Louis van Gaal.
""Manchester United have always bought players in but also have had a great scouting system which Sir Alex Ferguson put in quite a few years ago, where we did create home-grown talent, and that is something we have done over the years,"" said the former England captain.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""I think Louis van Gaal is a talented manager, he is well respected and with Manchester United this is a project that will hopefully last for a few years and be a successful one.
""Hopefully we have still got young players coming through.""
For many years United had a strong core of home-grown youth players under former boss Ferguson, with the renowned 'Class  of 92' - which included Beckham, Paul Scholes and Phil and Gary Neville - coming through the ranks.
As well as Colombian Falcao, new boss Van Gaal has also brought in Angel Di Maria for a British-record £59.7m, midfielder Ander Herrera for £29m from Athletic Bilbao, left-back Luke Shaw in a £27m move from Southampton, the £16m Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon and midfielder Daley Blind from Ajax for £13.8m.
Meanwhile, United youngsters Tom Lawrence, Nick Powell and Michael Keane left on Monday, either on loan or permanently.
However, defender Tyler Blackett, a youth academy product, has played in the Premier League this season, while defender Reece James and goalkeeper Ben Amos have been included in the matchday squad.
But Phelan, who was Ferguson's assistant between 2008 and 2013, believes the big-money arrivals at Old Trafford could suggest a change of philosophy at the club.
""There is always the start of something and maybe this is the start of a new way of doing things at Manchester United and maybe that is the way football is going,"" he added.
""Is it better to look at the instant rather than the future? It is a difficult one because youth is always the future, we all have to start somewhere and you just hope that product of youth can develop in the Premier League.""
Phelan expects Arsenal to give Welbeck the chance to flourish after finding his chances limited at United.
Gunners boss Arsene Wenger already has a number of England internationals in his squad, with Jack Wilshere, Theo Walcott, Kieran Gibbs and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all first-team regulars when fit.
England squad member Calum Chambers was signed in the summer from Southampton and the defender has made three Premier League appearances this season.
""He is still only a young player and with young players you will get peaks and troughs but it is a case of Danny feeling more important in himself than he probably was over the last 12 months,"" added Phelan.
""He is in a position where he can play where he wants and I think that is why he chose Arsenal because they give him the opportunity to play in his best position, which is a striker.""","Former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan feels part of the club's ""identity has been broken"" with Danny Welbeck's departure to Arsenal."
"Thomas Scanlon, 23, attacked Jamie Bagnall with a piece of wood at a flat in Pensarn near Rhyl, Denbighshire, Mold Crown Court heard.
Scanlon, of no fixed abode but who had lived at Rhos-on-Sea, admitted wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm.
On Monday, he was jailed for four-and-a-half years.
Prosecuting barrister James Coutts said Scanlon was in a relationship with Mr Bagnall's sister. It was accepted Mr Bagnall had stolen an iPad from her, and the defendant had made a threat to ""get"" him.
The court heard that after the attack in March 2015, he posted the photograph of Mr Bagnall cowering on the floor on Facebook with a caption which read ""I am sorry, ha, ha, ha"".
Mr Bagnall, who has since moved to the Manchester area, needed surgery, had severe injuries including four deep cuts to the head and an injury to his elbow.
Owen Edwards, defending, said he appreciated that he had got himself into a huge amount of trouble.
Judge Niclas Parry told him: ""This was a revenge attack - a total over-reaction to a dispute between you and Mr Bagnall.""
A 10-year restraining order was made preventing him from contacting Mr Bagnall.",A man who attacked another man in a row over a stolen iPad and then posted a photograph of his injured victim on social media has been jailed.
"Ronan O'Mahony and James Cronin both notched two tries with Tommy O'Donnell and the Scannell brothers Niall and Rory also touching down for Munster.
Derick Minnie scored a first-half try for Zebre as Munster led 24-7 at the break with Lloyd Greeff also scoring for the Pro12's bottom club in Parma.
The Italian club have lost 16 of their 17 Pro12 matches this season.
Ireland hooker Niall Scannell finished off a maul to open Munster's account in the third minute before his fellow international O'Donnell extended the lead on 18 minutes.
After wing O'Mahony's first try, Minnie replied for Zebre on the half-hour mark before a Tyler Bleyendaal penalty left Munster 17 points clear at half-time.
Munster centre Scannell joined his older brother on the scoreboard with the first try of the second half to ensure his side a bonus point, before O'Mahony secured his brace after Marcello Violi was sin-binned for the hosts.
Despite their numerical disadvantage, Zebre reduced the deficit to 12 points through a converted try from South African Greeff with just under 25 minutes to play.

"Police said the 61-year-old man had left his own vehicle when he was struck by the lorry shortly after 13:00. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The eastbound carriageway was closed at Junction 3 while emergency services attended, but has since reopened.
Police said they were attempting to establish the full circumstances of the incident.",A man has died after being hit by a lorry on the M8 at Livingston in West Lothian.
"He was playing against opponents who, earlier that season, had wound him up so badly that it completely put him off his game. Players who 24 hours earlier had spoken to a newspaper to explain, in detail, how this imposter was going to be stopped.
The supporters didn't like him. Nothing was going right.
And then, taking possession 40 yards out, Ibrahimovic explodes.
A dart forward. The acceleration beginning. A quick stepover, round one opponent, speed increasing. Another stepover. Outside another, back inside the same man as he tries to recover and then a shot into the bottom corner from 18 yards.
""He could have passed,"" recalled one of the opponents he had left trailing in his wake. ""But he had read the article. It was as if he was saying, 'Forget it guys. It's me'.""
Ibrahimovic was not finished. Initial glee, wide smile, on bended knee, waving an arm in mock celebration to show how easy it was. Then something else, more serious, a point to be made. A cup-eared celebration, blowing kisses to the crowd who were already in a state of fury.
He was 19.
The goal is well known among Swedish fans. The reaction to it new.
It is part of a documentary 'Becoming Zlatan' to be released in August that contains remarkable archive footage of Ibrahimovic's early years at Malmo.
Getting such close access at an early stage of his career was sheer good fortune for brothers Fredrik and Magnus Gertten, who shot the footage in 2000 and 2001 as part of a film intended to show the conflict between young and older players at their beloved Malmo.
They needed a focus for each side of the debate. They had heard of Ibrahimovic and approached him.
""The way he saw it, of course we should make a documentary him,"" said  Fredrik.
""It suited his self image. He was only 17 but he had a very strong confidence that he would make it because he had something special.""
Manchester United's newest recruit has a reputation for saying what he thinks.
Numerous times in recent weeks he refused to say where he was going, even though his destination after leaving Paris St-Germain was obvious. Instead he said he amused himself by reading what was being written and would eventually let everyone know, at a time of his choosing.
He meant it. When he posted United's badge on Instagram, he even beat his new club to the news by 24 hours.
""We are not part of the football world,"" said Gertten. ""Our business is making social and political films. Our initial experience of dealing with footballers was that nothing of them ever comes out in what they say. Their words are controlled, boring, nothing.
""Zlatan was different. Here was a young guy who said interesting things, very honest things about himself and his emotions. It was so fresh. It made you feel warm towards him.
""The problem is people don't always like honesty. When someone says what they think it can be painful.""
His Croatian mother and hard-drinking Bosnian father were divorced and Ibrahimovic lived with the latter on the outskirts of town, moving regularly to earn the nickname 'gypsy',
His talent was honed on a small shale pitch outside his mum's flat. For him, football was, has been and remains fun.
As a teenager with Malmo, rather than simply beating opponents much older, he preferred balancing the ball on his foot and lifting it past them. To supporters it is magical. To opponents infuriating.
""I am just teasing,"" he said. ""If it's not fun it's not worth playing.""
Such arrogance does not come without a downside... there were times in his youth when Ibrahimovic seemed unmanageable.
Here was a kid, accepted by football people at Malmo as having the capability to become the best they had ever had, whose behaviour was so bad, even in the notoriously flexible world of football conduct, he nearly ended up without a club.
School was missed, regularly. He would spark fights in training with his poor discipline. It was the same in matches.
""He simply did not obey the rules,"" said Gertten.
""There was a really complex aura around him. He was over the top, aggressive. He did dirty things. Parts of the Malmo board wanted to kick him out of the club.""
When his mum and dad split, Ibrahimovic went to live with his dad, Sefik. His sister stayed with his mum.
The finer points of parenting were lost to Sefik. Frequently, there was beer in the fridge but no food.
In the documentary, Ibrahimovic explains with pride how he has learned to cook and fend for himself, all apart from his laundry, which he still took to his mum.
Yet, despite the hardship, the bond with his father is strong. The need to please obvious.
Remarkably though, Ibrahimovic's mum only found out her son was moving from Malmo to Ajax for a club record 8.7m euros in 2001 after seeing it on a television report. The teenager had asked his dad what he thought of the Dutch giants, but kept the news that discussions had already taken place a secret.
""There is a mystery around Zlatan which is hiding some part of him,"" said Gertten.
""It goes back to his childhood. You still love your mum and dad but the child who has a problem at home normally doesn't want to talk about it because they are trying to protect their family.
""His dad didn't watch him often but you could see what it meant to Zlatan any time he did.
""But his childhood also meant he had to make his own rules. He didn't have the same integration in society as others.""
If Ibrahimovic likes someone, the bond endures. However, if feelings go the other way, the dislike lingers.
Leo Beenhakker was the technical director at Ajax who took a chance on the Swede, and Ibrahimovic has never forgotten it.
Louis van Gaal followed him into the job. Ibrahimovic did not like it, or him. It is why, had Van Gaal remained at Old Trafford, there was no chance the 34-year-old would have moved to United.
Jose Mourinho (Inter Milan) good. Pep Guardiola (Barcelona) bad.
""If you treat him with respect he will treat you with respect,"" said Gertten. ""If you don't he will be a complicated man for you.""
Ibrahimovic's loyalty is underlined by the well-documented scissor-throwing incident involving Mido at Ajax in 2003.
After a defeat at PSV Eindhoven, the two got into an argument after Ibrahimovic accused Mido of not passing. In the heated exchange, the Egyptian, who had been cutting the tape from his socks, threw a pair of scissors which narrowly missed the side of the Swede's head.
Within 10 minutes, all had been forgiven and the pair were joking about it in a jacuzzi.
Ibrahimovic was the first person to publicly speak out for his friend. ""I made mistakes in Sweden,"" he said. ""It's a new day. You become older. You grow up.""
And then, to the television journalist posing the questions, he said: ""Have you made mistakes? Nobody is talking about them because you are only a reporter.""
We know so much about Ibrahimovic. But what do we really know?
In the documentary, as a teenager in Sweden, he speaks often about his girlfriend and the life they will have together in the Netherlands. She also thinks that is how it will be. Yet when he went to Amsterdam, she was hardly ever spotted at Ajax and one day he announced, glibly, that they had split.
Long hours were spent alone at his house in a small suburb of the Dutch capital - the kind of place perfect for a young family but completely at odds with the wild child image growing around him.
""I met him a lot during those early years,"" said Gertten.
""In the same year as Ibrahimovic made his debut for Malmo, the papers started with specialist sports sections. He was born for that. There were Zlatan headlines every week for a whole year even though Malmo were in the second division.
""In the beginning he was really flattered but suddenly the newspapers were doing conflict stories.
""When he got his driving licence he went to the area where the prostitutes were and pretended to be the police and scared away the customers. It was a practical joke. But it got headlines. That was shocking for him. He was upset about it.""
It is many years since Gertten and Ibrahimovic spoke. The player's advisors were told of the documentary. They did not obstruct its making, neither have they assisted.
The material, 15 years old, has been sifted through meticulously, most of it didn't make the cut. What did is compelling.
""I once read a book by a researcher who did work with kids who ticked all the boxes for someone who would go to prison,"" said Gertten. ""With the ones who didn't, one of the things that saved them was the ability to create positive emotions.
""In that sense, Zlatan's smile has been a lifesaver. The warmth that comes out of that smile makes people want to help him. They forgive him things that weren't too smart. That smile has a magic. It is really strong with him. He can turn everything around with a smile.""

"To give some idea of the amount of the currency that represents - there were more than 90 billion banknotes in circulation in India last March.
Most central banks destroy soiled and mutilated banknotes on a regular basis and replace them with new, crisp ones.
The Reserve Bank of India, similarly, shreds such notes and makes briquettes of them. But they are not your usual briquettes.
Briquettes - usually made of farm waste in India - are used for cooking, lighting and heating. They are cheaper than coal, have lower ash content, are less polluting, and easier to store and pack. They are mostly used as fuel in factory boilers.
But briquettes made out of shredded cash are brittle and serve no such purpose, a senior central bank official told me.
So the bank's 27 shredding and briquetting machines in 19 offices across India will now snip the expired banknotes into the smallest of pieces and the resulting briquettes will be then dumped in India's vast landfills.
Sometimes the shredded currency is also recycled to make files, calendars and paper weights and ballpoint pen shells, tea coasters, cups and small trays as souvenirs for guests.
The practice is similar in the US: counterfeit banknotes are sent to the Secret Service, while unfit notes are shredded and sent to landfills or given away as souvenirs to the public touring the Federal Reserve Bank.
Central bank officials believe shredding 20 billion banknotes will not be a huge challenge. In 2015-16 the Reserve Bank of India destroyed more than 16 billion soiled notes. More than 14 billion were removed in 2012-2013 after nearly 500,000 fake notes were found in the system.
""Destroying so much cash is not a challenge because we have enough shredding and briquetting machines with very high capacities. These are automatic machines which shred the cash into the finest of pieces,"" says an official.  So, India's mountain of expired currency will soon become rubbish, literally.","India's central bank will have to destroy, by one estimate, some 20 billion ""expired"" banknotes after it scrapped two high-value denominations - the 500 ($7.60) and 1,000 rupee notes - this month to crack down on ""black money"" or illegal cash holdings."

"Many researchers thought ministers would sit on this controversial issue. Instead, the chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, has announced that draft regulations will be published within months.
She predicts that couples affected by mitochondrial disease could benefit from the treatment within two years, enabling them to have healthy children.
So why is this such a significant moment?
Firstly the UK will become the first country to allow the technique, aimed at preventing a range of potentially deadly genetic disorders.
This will underline Britain's pioneering role in genetics and IVF stretching back to both the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 and the birth of Louise Brown, the world's first test tube baby, in 1978.
Secondly, the technique itself will result in babies with DNA from three people - two women and a man - and this genetic alteration will be passed down the generations.
Once babies have been born using this technique, there will be no going back. A permanent and novel genetic change to members of the human race will have been made.
That might sound pretty worrying, and talk of three people's DNA mixed together seems a bit ghoulish at first glance.  So is this science overstepping the mark?
A public consultation conducted by the fertility regulator, the HFEA, found there was broad support for the technique, once the details had been explained.
So let's look briefly at the science.
Mitochondria are the energy factories of cells. They contain a tiny bit of DNA and just 37 genes, sitting outside the nucleus which has more than 20,000 genes - including all the crucial genetic material from both parents.
Mitochondrial disorders are always passed down the maternal line in the egg, so the technique being pioneered by Prof Doug Turnbull and his team at Newcastle University involves using healthy donor eggs.
Put briefly, conventional IVF is performed and then, after fertilisation, the pro-nuclei of the father and mother - you can see them clearly as the two round balls inside the glass tube in the picture above - are sucked out of the developing embryo.
This leaves behind the faulty mitochondria. The parents' genetic material is then injected into a healthy donor egg which has had its pro-nuclei removed but still has healthy mitochondria.
The scientists believe the resulting embryo should develop normally. It means all the crucial parental genes will be retained, plus a tiny amount of DNA from the female donor.
So how much DNA from the second woman is there? There is 1.05 metres of DNA in the nucleus and 0.0054 mm of DNA in our mitochondria.
Let's put that another way.  If you imagine the DNA in your nucleus - remember this is all the important stuff which makes us what we are - and stretched it from Trafalgar Square to Prof Turnbull's laboratory in Newcastle, you'd have a double helix of 282 miles.
Now if you laid all the DNA from the mitochondria alongside it, it would stretch from Trafalgar Square, barely round the corner to the National Portrait Gallery - just a couple of hundred yards.  That perhaps gives you an idea of just how little DNA is involved.
The scientists in Newcastle say their technique is akin to changing the battery of a laptop computer. The hard-drive - containing all the important information - is the parental DNA in the nucleus which remains unchanged. The battery is simply the power source.
Animal research and a number of scientific reviews suggest the technique is safe. But the Newcastle team reckon they have another year or more research to do before they will be completely satisfied.
One limiting factor for the researchers is the shortage of healthy donor eggs. They need women in the Newcastle area who are prepared to altruistically donate their eggs.
Another team in Oregon is using a similar technique and is discussing future research with the American regulators.
The next step here will be the publication of draft regulations.
There will be a debate and a free vote in parliament. A final scientific review of safety will be made and then assuming all hurdles have been passed, it will be open to the Newcastle team to apply for a licence from the HFEA. Each case, each couple being treated, will require a separate licence.
But before then, further public debate is being actively encouraged - this is an occasion where science, ethics and regulation seem to be proceeding at the same pace.
There will be some who find this disturbing - tampering with nature. But for the families affected by mitochondrial disease it is a chance to have a healthy child, and to ensure that future generations are healthy too.
We may look back on this development as one of the key moments in science and ethics of modern times.",The decision of the government to support a ground-breaking technique for preventing serious genetic disease is a bold step for science and society.
"A man was arrested after the fires at Wasserstein and police suspect arson. No-one in the hostels was badly hurt.
More than a million refugees and migrants have arrived in Germany this year, and for most their first stop has been in Bavaria.
President Joachim Gauck devoted his Christmas message to the recent influx.
""We have shown what we are capable of, in terms of good will and professionalism, but also in the art of improvisation,"" he said, praising fellow Germans for their response to the crisis.
But he also called for the full force of the law to be used against anyone using violence against the new arrivals.
""Arson and attacks on defenceless people deserve our contempt and deserve punishment,"" the president said.
Refugee hostels in Germany have come under more than 200 attacks this year alone, according to research by Die Zeit newspaper, but the authorities have secured convictions against only a handful of attackers.
Migrant crisis explained in maps and graphics
Germany's 'historic test' - Merkel
Reports of Merkel's demise are greatly exaggerated
Year of the migrant - a crisis unlike all others
Chancellor Angela Merkel promised last week that Germany would ""noticeably reduce the number of refugees"" in response to criticism from within her centre-right CDU party.
Up to 40% of arrivals in Germany have come from Balkan countries such as Albania and Kosovo which are considered safe. Most of the other arrivals are refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
European countries have struggled to cope with the large number of people reaching the shores of the EU. This week, international migration officials said more than a million ""irregular"" migrants and refugees had come by land and sea, the vast majority via Greece.
Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka singled out Mrs Merkel for blame for sending out a signal across the Middle East and Africa which ""stimulated illegal migration to Europe"".
UN refugee officials say 3,716 people died or went missing this year as they tried to cross into Europe.
But there was good news for one Afghan family who feared their 10-year-son had drowned off the Turkish coast.
The Rabani family, who have since arrived in the German state of Lower Saxony, became separated from their son as they boarded a boat in Turkey. His boat capsized and many of those on board drowned.
A German Red Cross official eventually succeeded in tracking down the child, who was found staying at a refugee hostel in Switzerland. The family hope to be reunited in a few weeks' time.
In a separate development, a young Palestinian refugee who made headlines in July when she cried in front of Mrs Merkel has reportedly been told by German immigration officials that she and her family will be able to stay in the country until 2017.
Reem Sahwil, 14, had told the chancellor on live TV that she wanted to go to university but she burst into tears when the chancellor explained that not all migrants could stay in Germany and that politics ""can be tough"".
Mrs Merkel tried to comfort the girl by stroking her head.","Twelve people were hurt, including seven teenagers, when fires broke out at two neighbouring refugee hostels in the south German region of Bavaria."

City are now 10 points behind leaders Chelsea after defeat on Merseyside - the heaviest league loss in Guardiola's managerial career.
Asked if the gap was too great, he said: ""Yes. Ten is a lot of points.""
Guardiola, 45, has told his players to unite ""in the bad moments"" and ""forget the table"" until the end of the season.
He added: ""At the end of the season, we are going to evaluate our level and how our performance was, how the coach was, how the players were. After that we are going to decide.""
The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss insisted he was ""so happy in Manchester"" despite his side sitting fifth, two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal.
Guardiola watched City dominate possession on Merseyside but concede four from the six shots they faced.
Only five teams have a lower haul than their four clean sheets in the league - BBC Radio 5 live pundit Robbie Savage said City ""cannot defend"" and questioned if Guardiola would now change his style.
City are the only team in the Premier League to have over 50% of possession in every game this season but they have now conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their last seven games.
Guardiola added: ""I said to the players be positive because you made some fantastic things during the season and for many reasons we didn't get what I think we deserved.
""In the bad moments we have to be close. It's awful for my players. We created chances but don't score and when they have a chance, they punish us.""
Everton scored with their first two shots through Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas, with Tom Davies and Ademola Lookman completing the rout.
Lookman's goal came after a John Stones clearance was charged down, throwing the young defender again under the spotlight.
It was Stones' first visit to Goodison Park since leaving Everton for City in a £47.5m deal last summer.
The 22-year-old has been criticised for making too many mistakes, and former Manchester United and Everton defender Phil Neville believes he is being unfairly singled out.
However, fellow pundit Alan Shearer told Match of the Day 2: ""John Stones did have a nightmare. He is 22 now, he has played nearly 100 Premier League games and everyone keeps saying to me and to the rest of the football world, that he is going to be a top player.
""If I'm a centre forward, a young guy and I keep on missing chances, I don't expect to be in the team. Eventually you are going to get left out. I keep seeing Stones making mistakes too often, too many times.""

"But health officials have warned that unless MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations continue, a further outbreak cannot be ruled out.
There have been no laboratory-confirmed cases linked to the outbreak area since 22 May, Public Health Wales said.
One person died and a total of 1,219 measles cases were diagnosed during the outbreak since November.
Some 88 people visited a hospital due to the disease while a campaign was launched to boost the uptake of the MMR vaccine.
Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales (PHW), said that the end of the outbreak was in ""no small part to unprecedented efforts to vaccinate tens of thousands of people"".
""Without so many vaccinations being given, we know that the outbreak could have continued for many more months,"" said Dr Lyons.
But PHW warned that with 30,000 children in the 10 to 18 years age group still unvaccinated across Wales, there was still a possibility of a further outbreak in the future.
And the health minister urged parents to get their children vaccinated.
Dr Lyons said: ""The only reason this outbreak could happen was because not enough young people in Wales were fully vaccinated with two doses of MMR and there is absolutely no guarantee that this could not happen again.""
Some 75,868 unscheduled vaccinations were given to people around Wales who had not been immunised in a bid to bring the epidemic under control.
GP surgeries, hospital and schools held drop-in sessions, with PHW particularly keen to target children and young people who may have missed their scheduled jabs.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he ""wholeheartedly"" welcomed the end of the outbreak but insisted there was ""still work to do"".
""The young people in the 10 to 18 age group who still have not been vaccinated should make the necessary arrangements at their earliest convenience,"" he added.
""We would not want to see another outbreak.
""I would like to thank the healthcare professionals for their tireless work in organising and staffing the unscheduled vaccinations drop-in sessions and GPs for the contribution of primary care among others.""
Large numbers of children in the 10-18 age group were not given the MMR vaccine as babies, the result of a scare that caused panic among parents.
It followed research by Dr Andrew Wakefield in the late 1990s which linked the vaccine with autism and bowel disease.
His report, which was published in The Lancet medical journal, was later discredited, with health officials insisting the vaccine was completely safe.
PHW said that even though the outbreak was over, a small number of measles cases were seen in Wales every year - in 2011 there were 19 cases - and parents should still ensure their children were fully vaccinated.
The first dose of MMR should be given at around 12-13 months of age and the second at around three years and four months of age - but it is never too late to catch up on missed doses, say health officials.
PHW advises that anyone born in 1970 or later who has not had measles or two doses of MMR should be vaccinated.
Any babies younger than 12 months who were advised to receive early vaccination as a result of the outbreak will still be called for routine vaccination and should still attend these appointments.
It is not dangerous to receive more than two doses of the vaccine, PHW added.
The measles outbreak centred on the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg health board area - which covers Swansea and Neath Port Talbot - along with the Powys health board area and Hywel Dda, which covers Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion.
The Welsh Conservatives renewed their calls for a public inquiry into the epidemic so that lessons could be learned and failings identified.
On Monday, an inquest heard that Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, died from pneumonia after contracting measles during the Swansea outbreak.
He was found dead on his sofa in his flat on 18 April, days after seeing GPs and complaining of a rash all over his body.",The measles epidemic centred on the Swansea area has been declared over eight months after it began.

'Grandiose plan'
The concert was staged by the Moranbong band as its debut performance on Friday, reported state media KCNA.
The band was put together by Kim Jong-un, who has a ''grandiose plan to bring about a dramatic turn in the field of literature and arts this year"", state media said.
North Korean entertainment has traditionally featured nationalist or folk songs, and mass displays.
In recent years, reports say, children in the isolated country have become familiar with characters such as Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh through stationery items and clothes imported from China, North Korea's closest ally.
It seems to point to an easing of North Korea's paranoia about what it calls spiritual pollution from the West, and even more dangerously, South Korea, says the BBC's Charles Scanlon.
It is still illegal to watch South Korean television programmes in North Korea. But a recent report based on interviews with refugees said that North Koreans now have more access to outside media, especially DVDs of popular South Korean drama serials.

Part of the film studio's argument was that it should not need to change the name, citing EU law which states a trademark must be ""a sign"", in the sense of being a single sign and capable of being ""graphically represented"".  The show's name, it said, did not fall into this category.
As a result, the judges have asked the two parties and the UK Intellectual Property Office to enter their submissions on the issue by Monday when they will consider whether to send the case to the European courts.

"Earlier the Saudi foreign ministry said it had turned down the non-permanent seat, accusing the world body of ""double standards"".

It said the Security Council had failed in its duties towards Syria as well as in other world conflicts.
Mr Ban refused to say whether he would be speaking to the Saudi king about the matter.
""I understand that some member states, particularly some concerned group of member states, are discussing [this] among themselves,"" Mr Ban said.
The reaction among diplomats to this unprecedented decision has been one of shock and confusion, the BBC's Nada Tawfik reports from the UN.

""The fact is that the Security Council has been unable to act now for more than two years,"" Mr Araud said, according to AFP.
However, Russia's foreign ministry called the move bewildering, and said Saudi Arabia's criticism of the UN Security Council about its actions over Syria ""is particularly strange"".
By Bridget KendallDiplomatic correspondent, BBC News
Usually there is fierce competition to secure one of the 10 rotating seats on the UN Security Council - a chance to sit alongside the five permanent members for two years  on the top UN body which rules on international security issues.
Instead Saudi Arabia  has used the coveted position to lodge a very public protest.
This is the second protest from Saudi Arabia. Earlier this month the Saudi foreign minister pulled out of giving a speech at the UN General Assembly, expressing similar frustration.
It is a dramatic gesture, but whether it makes immediate reform of the Security Council more likely, as the Saudis demand, is probably questionable.
Saudi Arabia has previously expressed frustration at what it sees as an international failure to act on Syria, where it staunchly backs the rebels.
The announcement came hours after Saudi Arabia was elected for the first time to one of the 10 rotating seats on the Security Council.
The non-permanent members sit on the council for two years, along with the five permanent members - the US, the UK, France, China and Russia.
As well as accusing the council of ""double-standards"" and demanding reform, the Saudi foreign ministry pointed to its failure ""to find a solution to the Palestinian cause for 65 years"", which had led to ""numerous wars that have threatened world peace"".
It also criticised the UN's ""failure"" to rid the Middle East region of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons.
And it accused the UN of allowing the Syrian government ""to kill its own people with chemical weapons... without confronting it or imposing any deterrent sanctions"".
The UN Security Council last month finally broke a two-and-a-half year deadlock on how to deal with conflict in Syria after voting unanimously to adopt a binding resolution on ridding the country of chemical weapons.

"Cummings was in the right place at the right time to convert David Gray's cross for his first.
And the 21-year-old rolled in an opportunistic second from a tight angle when he capitalised on a mix-up in the Buddies' defence.
New signings Andrew Shinnie and Brian Graham both came off the bench to make their debuts for Hibs.
Graham in particular had a brilliant chance to score his first goal for the Leith side but Saints goalkeeper Scott Gallacher blocked the effort.
Former Buddie John McGinn cracked the angle of post and cross-bar late on and any critics of Cummings would say the forward should have gone home with a hat-trick ball.
His double here brought his tally for the season to five already, and the deflected cross from energetic captain Gray only needed a left-foot steer into the net.
Being in the right place to capitalise was key for Cummings, and 10 minutes later his persistence at pestering St Mirren defender Jack Baird and keeper Gallacher was rewarded.
The St Mirren duo left a back-pass to each other and Cummings nipped in to clinically score from a tight angle.
Lennon's managerial effect from the sidelines is clear. Fifteen minutes into this match the former Celtic boss was berating Hibs centre-back Darren McGregor for a lack of urgency.
Players paid attention to Lennon's demands to ""move it quickly"" and ""get it forward"".
Cummings received an earful for a poor second-half pass and Marvin Bartley was rebuked for moaning at the referee. Lennon has got his team by the scruff of the neck.
St Mirren's home form under Alex Rae has been better than his predecessors but there was not much for the locals to get excited about on this occasion - indeed some booed at half-time.
Baird watched his header sail over and substitute David Clarkson shot narrowly wide, but the impression was Hibs had another gear in them if required.
Hibs boss Neil Lennon: ""Jason Cummings is a goalscorer but there's more to his game.
""He got two brilliant goals and could've had a couple more. I thought he got sloppy in the second half and looked a little bit tired.
""If you'd been watching him in the first half you could have had Real Madrid on the phone. But if you'd been watching him second half you would've had Accrington Stanley on the phone - and that's no disrespect to Accrington.""
St Mirren manager Alex Rae: ""The fact is that we dug in and competed in the second half.
""You can't legislate for that second goal. No matter what the preparation is, it's just a miscommunication and it becomes difficult because you're chasing the game.

"Almost none of these will work. Why?
Because, on current polling, it all comes down to whether you think the people voting for Andy Burnham or those voting for Yvette Cooper are more likely to put Corbyn as their next preference.
And there is no decent publicly available evidence that either of them are. Furthermore, for similar reasons, there is no arithmetic reason why non Corbyn candidates withdrawing would do anything to stop Corbyn.
Voters in this election will be given the opportunity to rank the candidates in order of preference. The first preferences are counted up, and the person with the fewest is eliminated from the contest - and the votes they received are given to whoever each person that voted for them rated as their second preference.
If after that none of the candidates has achieved 50% of the vote, the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated and their votes are given to whoever they put as their higher preference amongst the two remaining candidates. By definition, this gives one of the two remaining candidates a majority of the votes.
Current polling puts Corbyn first, Cooper and Burnham roughly tied in second, and Kendall trailing in third. So either Cooper or Burnham will most likely be the candidate that faces Corbyn in the final round. If you want to stop Corbyn, you'll be voting for some combination of Cooper, Burnham and Kendall as your first three preferences. So your vote WILL end up being for whoever faces Corbyn in the final round, WHICHEVER order you put those three in.
The only way you can affect the number of votes Corbyn gets is by trying to second-guess the second preferences of people that vote for eliminated candidates. If you believe the polls, Kendall's almost certain to be eliminated first, so you can't affect that. But one of Burnham and Cooper won't be eliminated before the final run off with Corbyn. Whichever one is eliminated will have their preferences redistributed to either Corbyn or his opponent.
So, in theory, if you, the ""stop Corbyn"" voter thought that, say, Burnham's supporters are more likely to have Corbyn as their next preference than Cooper's, you should put Burnham ahead of Cooper in your preference list even if you ACTUALLY prefer Cooper to Burnham - because it'll starve Corbyn of the extra votes he'd get if Burnham was knocked out.
The thing is, I am not aware of any decent evidence that this is the case. We have very few polls on the Labour leadership election - and those that exist (necessarily) have small samples of what Burnham and Cooper's second preferences would be. Very roughly speaking, the polling tables I've seen suggest supporters of both split their second preferences about 30/70 between Corbyn and his opponent. So it's not clear which of these you should give a higher preference to tactically stop Corbyn anyway.
In other words, there is no obvious way to tactically vote against Corbyn. If you want to stop him he'll be your last preference anyway - and it literally doesn't matter what order your first three preferences are in. Crazy thought though it might be, you can happily vote for candidates on the basis of, y'know, how good you think they are.
This actually has implications for people dropping out of the race as well. Ballot papers have already gone out, but Cooper could, for example, tell all her supporters to first preference Andy Burnham instead. In terms of tactical voting, there is NO POINT in any of the three non Corbyn candidates doing this. All their votes will be aggregated to support whoever faces Corbyn in the final round anyway as a result of the preference system.
Of course, that's just on the arithmetic. There might be a case for candidates dropping out if they think that a unified anti-Corbyn campaign would be more effective at winning over existing Corbyn supporters - perhaps because they spend less time attacking each other. But this is necessarily pretty speculative, especially this late in the game.

"Charlton had thrashed Rovers 5-1 at the Memorial Stadium in November and they were convincing victors again, although they had to do it the hard way after a mistake by Patrick Bauer gifted Rovers a 12th-minute lead.
The Addicks defender slipped while attempting a back pass, enabling Jermaine Easter to burst clear on goal and round Dillon Phillips before slotting into an empty net.
Magennis' free-kick hit the crossbar, while Adam Chicksen's cross was tipped behind by Will Puddy via the woodwork as Charlton sought an equaliser before the break.
Parity was restored four minutes before the interval with Magennis heading home from Joe Aribo's free-kick.
And the duo combined in almost identical circumstances five minutes into the second half, an unmarked Magennis again using his head to convert from Aribo's set-piece delivery.
Aribo turned provider once again just after the hour, playing a low ball across the face of goal which was swept in from close range by Jorge Teixeira to make it 3-1.
Magennis completed his treble after 73 minutes, latching on to Andrew Crofts' pass and then firing an angled shot beyond Puddy in some style.

""I know the trauma and the anguish you must be going through.""
He was interrupted by a member of the public knocking on the window of the public gallery.
The judge asked them to leave the court and for people to ""respect the rule of law"" in a case where ""emotions are flying high"".
During the short hearing, Mr Casey spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth.
He did not enter pleas but the court was told he was likely to do so when the case is next heard.

Although the president-elect will not go to Davos, one of his top advisers - hedge fund boss Anthony Scaramucci - will speak about the new US leader's plans on Tuesday.
Mr Trump, whose ""America first"" pledge helped him win the White House, has also threatened to hike tariffs on goods imported from China.
Mr Xi is taking China's biggest delegation to the elite gathering in Davos, and his appearance is seen as an attempt to present the country as a world leader.
His entourage includes some of China's most successful business people, such as Jack Ma, the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, and property magnate Wang Jianlin, who runs the conglomerate Dalian Wanda.
China's vice foreign minister Li Baodong has said Mr Xi will detail the country's views on how to ""steer economic globalisation towards greater inclusiveness"".
Despite the apparent hostility between the US and China, Mr Xi has spoken of a smooth communication channel with Mr Trump's team, and reports suggest the Chinese president would be willing to meet members of the US president-elect's team whilst in Davos.
Mr Xi's attendance has been welcomed by WEF founder Klaus Schwab, who said he expects him to ""show how China will assume in global affairs a responsive and responsible leadership role"".
Responsive and responsible leadership is the theme for this year's gathering, which comes after a year of dramatic events including the UK's Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump.
Mr Schwab has called on attendees to help ""overcome the present mood of divisiveness and negativism"".

"The source close to the inquiry played down the significance of the interviews carried out in Portugal on Tuesday.
Portuguese detectives in Faro were observed during the questioning by officers from the Met Police, which is conducting its own investigation.
Madeleine disappeared aged three in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz in 2007.
The source told the BBC: ""Questioning of the four suspects was concluded yesterday evening. Unfortunately the interviews have led to no new developments and we are back where we were seven years ago.""
The source added: ""The 'arguido' [suspect] status was given to the suspects to protect them. It gives them legal rights including the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present during interviews.
Jeremy Cooke, BBC News in Praia da Luz
It is clear that the latest developments in the Madeleine McCann case are the result of the detailed, painstaking work being done by British police officers working on Operation Grange.
As their investigation continues, they formally request assistance from the Portuguese police. It is at the request of Scotland Yard officers that four potential new suspects - or arguidos - and 11 potential witnesses are being interviewed.
Those interviews involve detectives from both countries; the Portuguese asking the questions, while the British monitor proceedings.
It is not clear what potential link the British team believe may exist between the ""suspects"" and the disappearance of the three year-old. But clearly there are lines of inquiry they believe are worth following up.
There are, however, clear tensions here. With one source close to the case saying that the investigation is going nowhere and ""we are back where we were seven years ago"".
""They were declared arguido due to being identified as suspects in a letter of international request sent by the British to the Portuguese authorities.""
The Portuguese Attorney General's Office in Lisbon issued a brief statement about the questioning of the four suspects.
It said that requests from the British authorities had been carried out but the content of these requests would remain confidential.
Police have begun the process of interviewing 11 witnesses, which also relates to official requests from the Metropolitan Police.
The source indicated that two tracker dogs from the UK could be used in searching a vehicle thought to belong to one of the witnesses. No time or location was given for this.
One of the four ""persons of interest"" - or arguidos - questioned was Sergey Malinka. He has always denied any involvement.
Mr Malinka, a Russian-born website designer with Portuguese nationality, was questioned as a witness in 2007 when Madeleine went missing.
On Tuesday, Mr Malinka and another suspect left the central police station in Faro after they were interviewed.
A third person, who is said to be suffering from severe schizophrenia, remained inside the police headquarters after the other two had left.
All of those being questioned are Portuguese citizens. They have all been summoned to be interviewed; there have been no arrests.
The status of arguidos in the Portuguese judicial system refers to individuals whom police may reasonably suspect are linked to a crime.
In June, Portuguese and British officers searched three sites in Praia da Luz but found no evidence relating to the case.
Scotland Yard said at the time that ""more activity"" had been agreed with Portuguese police and the searches were the ""first phase"" of a major investigation.
The McCann family - from Rothley, Leicestershire - were staying in an apartment in Praia da Luz when Madeleine was last seen.
Her parents had been at a restaurant near their apartment when she went missing.","Questioning of four suspects in the Madeleine McCann investigation has concluded without any new developments, a source has told the BBC."
"The former Sierra Leone tactician was dismissed on Thursday after 15 months in-charge of Amavubi.
McKinstry said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" and the reasons ""had not been made fully clear"" to him.
McKinstry took over the Rwanda job from Englishman Stephen Constantine who stepped down in March 2015.
The Northern Irishman then led Rwanda to the quarter final stage of the 2016 Africa Nations Championship that they hosted.
He also led the team to the runner-up spot in the 2015 Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
""The specific reasons behind the decision have not been made fully clear to me given our performance to date, I am therefore both surprised and disappointed by the announcement today, and that myself and the team will not be able to finish what we started,"" he said.
The 30-year old coach managed to record 11 wins, two draws and a dozen defeats in the 25 games he was in charge of Rwanda.
According to the Rwanda FA, McKinstry was sacked because he did not achieve some of the targets that had been set for him.

Pearson, back in management following his sacking by Leicester in June 2015, won the Championship title with the Foxes in 2013-14.
Derby County boss Nigel Pearson:
""I was very pleased with our determination and the fact that the players kept on trying to function as a team. Although we weren't playing at our best and didn't use the ball as well as I would have liked to have done, we worked really hard to protect our own goal.
""We had some very good chances early on, we started the first half very well and they started the second half very well.
""What's important for me with this performance and this result is that if people have the opinion that in the past we may have lost, I was interested and very pleased to see our players work so hard to not allow a tight game to go to the opponents.
""You've got to try and win games but if you can't win them you don't lose them and I think both managers would be saying very similar things.""
Brighton & Hove Albion manager Chris Hughton:
""I think in the last few years a draw here is going to be a very good result. I thought although we needed David Stockdale to make a couple of very good saves, we edged the chances.
""I thought we had the better of the chances but I thought on the balance of play a draw was probably a fair result. I think what you have with Glenn [Murray] is a player who will be a wonderful signing for us but he's come in on the back of a season last year when he didn't have too many starts.
""But he's a worker for the team so my delight with him is how he's got into those positions and if he does that enough times over a season he will score goals.
""Generally you don't know what you are going to get first game of the season but I thought the application of the team was excellent and apart from winning and goals I think I've got everything I wanted today.""

"A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth.
The proposal to allow abortion in such cases was defeated by 59 votes to 40.
The result followed a passionate debate at Stormont after some MLAs proposed the law change be introduced by way of an amendment to the Justice Bill.
Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland.
Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health.
Politicians have been lobbied to reform the law since 2013, when Northern Ireland woman Sarah Ewart spoke out about having to travel to Great Britain for an abortion after she was told she was carrying a baby that had no chance of survival.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) faced criticism from other parties during Wednesday's debate for asking the Health Minister Simon Hamilton to set up a working group to examine the issues raised by fatal foetal abnormality.
It could take six months for the group to complete its work and the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt claimed it was a DUP ""device"" to delay decision making on abortion reform until after May's assembly election.
Justice Minister David Ford, who brought forward the proposed change to the legislation, told Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show it could now remain in limbo for some time.
""It would appear that that is what some people want, that it was any excuse at all to avoid taking a decision last night so they can fudge the issue,"" he said.
""We will wait and see what happens to the DUP's supposed working group for the next six months. Certainly, we'll get the DUP past the election, maybe that's why they're doing it.""
However, the DUP has argued that the issue required proper consideration by MLAs and ministers and that the Justice Bill was not intended for this purpose.
The amendment to legalise abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality was proposed by Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson.
He told MLAs: ""If we are to continue to fail women in Northern Ireland in this area then we are abdicating our duties as representatives.
""The traumatic journey to England for many young women is becoming a shame on Northern Ireland and to force women with a fatal foetal pregnancy to look elsewhere for help and support make this worse.""
The amendment relating to pregnancies which are the result of rape or incest was put forward by Anna Lo, also of the Alliance Party, and was defeated by by 64 votes to 30.
Mr Nesbitt said that as a man he did not feel comfortable ""discussing what a woman should do with her body"" but he added that MLAs had a responsibility to legislate.
He claimed the DUP's request for a commission was a delaying tactic designed to ""kick the decision to the far side of the election"".
Mr Nesbitt described the delay as ""cruel"" and ""Dickensian"".
""This is Bleak House we're in today, in the Chancery courts waiting day after day, after day, after day for a decision that never comes,"" he said.
Sinn Féin MLA Caitríona Ruane also criticised the DUP for ""supporting a commission which will report in six months"".
""What about the plight of women in the here and now? What about the women who are pregnant as the result of rape, or women who are faced with fatal foetal abnormalities?
""Is the DUP going to tell them 'we're having a commission in six months and sure, then we'll see where is goes?'  I'm sorry, long-fingering this does a disservice to women,"" Ms Ruane said.
However, Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MLAs expressed doubt that doctors could accurately predict that an unborn child had no chance of survival.
SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said clinicians had told her party that ""there is no such definition"" as fatal foetal abnormality.
Speaking independently from her party, Alliance MLA Anna Lo proposed that women who have become pregnant as a result of sexual crime should have access to a legal abortion in Northern Ireland.
Ms Lo said that forcing pregnant rape victims to give birth meant they would be ""reminded every day of that act of violence which was forced upon her"".
However, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister described Ms Lo's amendment as a  ""charter for abortion on demand"".
He said that because of his background as a barrister he had more experience than most MLAs of rape trials and added that ""95% of the time, the question for the jury is - was the sexual intercourse consensual or not?""
""All you have to do is to allege indecent assault it seems, rape, and you're entitled on the nod of a medical practitioner to abortion,"" he said.
Mr Allister told MLAs that allegations of rape could only be proven through ""due process"" and this was not possible within the timeframe of pregnancy.
DUP MLA Emma Pengelly spoke in support of the working group on fatal foetal abnormality.
""I have not had the beautiful privilege to have brought a child into this world but I can empathise with all my heart that the wished for, the longed for, can turn so quickly to tragedy,"" she said.
""The way forward that we are proposing is a compassionate one, it is a sensible one, it is a common sense one that will leave all of us in a much better and informed position to chart a loving and kind way forward.""
At the end of the debate, Assembly Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin commended MLAs on the ""sense of dignity"" they displayed during the discussions.
Stormont's chief legal adviser, Attorney General John Larkin QC, is among those who are opposed to changing the law and has outlined concerns that the move could breach obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).
Precious Life, one of the largest pro life organisations in the region vowed to ""expose"" any MLA who voted in favour of the new legislation.
Amnesty International said failing to reform the law would be a ""betrayal of women"", while the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission urged political action.",Northern Ireland Assembly members have voted against legalising abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.
"The spacecraft, which takes visible and infrared pictures of the Earth, was launched in June and is now undergoing a period of commissioning.
The observer is the second dedicated mission to fly in the European Union's Copernicus programme.
This will see a multi-billion-euro series of satellite sensors put in orbit over the next few years.
Sentinel-2a, however, will be the system's backbone, producing a wide range of imaging products that will focus predominantly on the planet's land surface.
The European Space Agency, which led the development of the platform, released a taster on Monday of what to expect.
These views ranged from cities and forests to glaciers and coral reefs.
""They are stunning,"" said mission manager Bianca Hoersch.
""Okay, we still have some calibration work to do, on co-registration between visible and shortwave infrared bands, but I think you can see just from this release that the quality is going to be really excellent.""
Sentinel-2a is the European equivalent of America's Landsat mission, which has been imaging the surface of the Earth for 40 years.
The US satellite's data is free and open, which has driven a multitude of applications. Most people will probably know it best from the map tools they use on their computers and smartphones. These all incorporate Landsat pictures.
Sentinel's data has been designed to be complementary, but the platform also represents a big jump in capability.
Its imaging instrument will be sensitive across more bands of light (13 versus Landsat's eight), allowing it to discern more information about the land beneath it; and Sentinel-2a will ""carpet map"" a much wider strip of ground (290km versus 185km).
In addition, its colour images have a best resolution of 10m, versus Landsat's 30m.
Given that today, non-specialist use of Earth imagery overwhelmingly relies on Landsat data, it is more than probable that Sentinel products will be in big demand.
The European Commission will be using Sentinel pictures in its Copernicus programme to run variety of services, reaching across agriculture and forestry, urban planning and disaster mitigation.
Agriculture, though, is certain to be a big user. The satellite's camera sensor has been designed to detect very specific wavelengths of light that detail the health of plants.
In normal operation, Sentinel-2a will be producing 1.7 terabytes of processed data per day. And this will double when the sister satellite, Sentinel-2b, is launched next year.
""The data volume is incredible,"" Dr Hoersch told BBC News.
""Of course, we all knew it would be like this, but when you sit there with your computer and try to download it, it's massive - gigabytes of data.  I had to go out at the weekend and buy a hard disk to store all these products for my presentations.""
Esa will launch Sentinel-3a at the end of 2015. This satellite is dedicated to observing the oceans.

"The reforms are thought to include tax rises and pension changes.
Greece is due to present the proposals by 22:00 GMT on Thursday to try to secure a third bailout and prevent a possible exit from the eurozone.
The new proposals will be studied by eurozone finance ministers on Saturday and a full EU summit on Sunday.
Defence Minister and junior coalition party leader Panos Kammenos gave no further details of the agreed plans as he left the prime minister's official residence, where ministers had been meeting.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has spent the day discussing the proposals with his cabinet.
Greek media are reporting that the reforms will be put to the Greek parliament on Friday for approval.
On Wednesday Greece formally submitted a request for an unspecified loan from the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund.
This would be a fresh loan ""to meet Greece's debt obligations and to ensure stability of the financial system"", Greece says - in other words, to avoid bankruptcy.
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, who will chair Sunday's EU summit, said he hoped to receive ""concrete and realistic proposals of reforms from Athens"".
Such proposals ""will have to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability from the creditors. Only then will we have a win-win situation,"" Mr Tusk added.
However the German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that ""a classic haircut"" (meaning reducing the value of Greece's debts) was ""out of the question"" for her.
All Greek to you? Debt jargon explained
Speaking in Sarajevo, Mrs Merkel said the eurozone had dealt with the issue of debt sustainability in 2012.
She described Sunday's EU summit as a decisive and important meeting.
""We must not forget that the Greek people are suffering at the moment,"" she said.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble also ruled out debt relief for Greece, saying ""there cannot be a haircut because it would infringe the system of the European Union"".
Greece needs to implement reforms to win the trust of its eurozone partners, Mr Schaeuble said. He told a conference in Frankfurt that his message to the new Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos was: ""Just do it!"".

The Greek government has meanwhile extended bank closures and the €60 (£43; $66) daily limit on cash machine withdrawals until Monday.
The curbs were imposed on 28 June, after a deadlock in bailout talks with creditors led to a rush of withdrawals.
Louka Katseli, the head of the Greek bank association, said on Thursday that there was enough liquidity in cash machines to serve the public until Monday.

On Thursday, EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said he was hopeful of a new deal: ""I have the sense that the dialogue is established, or restored, and that there is a way out.""
The IMF, lowering its economic growth forecast for the world for 2015, said events in Greece would have a ""limited"" effect on the rest of the global economy, as Greece makes up just 2% of the eurozone.
What happens next?
European Stability Mechanism explained
Greece's creditors - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF - have already provided more than €200bn in two bailouts since a rescue plan began five years ago.
The second bailout expired on 30 June.
The creditors had hoped for new, concrete proposals from Greece at a meeting on Tuesday but these were not submitted and they instead agreed to set a new deadline of Thursday.
Greece has been warned this is the ""final deadline"".
Mr Tusk has said this is ""now maybe the most critical moment in the history of the eurozone"".
""This is really and truly the final wake-up call for Greece and for us, our last chance,"" he said, adding that failure ""may lead to the bankruptcy of Greece"".
Mr Tsipras's Syriza party was elected in January pledging to oppose the harsh austerity measures demanded by creditors.
And on Sunday, the Greek people decisively rejected the latest bailout proposals from creditors in a referendum.
Energy minister and influential Syriza member Panayiotis Lafazanis insisted on Thursday that Greece would not sign up to a third bailout if it brought ""harsh austerity, suffering and deprivation to the Greek people"".
He insisted Greece had ""alternative options to a new bailout deal"" and there was ""no gun pointed at its head"".
Supporters of Greece staying in the euro held a rally in central Athens on Thursday night.","Greece's government has agreed a reform programme and will submit its proposals to its international lenders soon, the defence minister has said."

Chris Horn, from Newbury in Berkshire, came up with the idea whilst on his tractor and hopes the idea could spread across the UK.
He says the business model could help other young farmers but adds that 40% of their revenue goes on licensing fees.",A fourth generation farmer has found a novel way to diversify his business by showing movies in his fields.
"The film told the story of a fictional plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un. Hackers broke into film company Sony's computers, and weeks later threatened to target any cinema which screened the film.
An FBI investigation concluded that North Korea was to blame for the cyber attack. North Korea responded angrily, with Kim Jong-un calling President Obama a ""monkey"".
What do we know about his ambitions? Four insiders offer their insight into what Kim Jong-un wants.
Jean Lee was born in America to South Korean parents and grew up hearing stories about Korean families separated by the war in 1953. A few years ago, she became the first foreign journalist to open a bureau inside North Korea.
She was in the crowd when Kim Jong-un was first introduced to the Korean people at a military parade, and says he has had to work hard to establish his own power base.
""When he came out there was just a complete sense of shock and awe among the people at the plaza. They had never seen a picture of him. They had only really known of his existence, officially, a few weeks earlier.
""It was quite a shock to see somebody so young who was being groomed to be the next leader. He was not the oldest son, so wasn't the obvious shoo-in. There's clearly something about him, ambition, perhaps a kind of ruthlessness, some qualities that his father saw in him that he thought would carry this country into the next generation.""
The world saw that ruthlessness a year ago, when he ordered the execution of his uncle for allegedly trying to overthrow the state. And the regime is known to use violence to quash dissent among ordinary people too.
But Jean Lee says it would be a mistake to think Kim Jong-un maintains control only through fear:
""One of the things that I've seen on the ground over the past couple of years is all the construction of these skating rinks. There's actually a skateboard park, the ski resort of course that opened last year, massive projects. I see all of this as an investment that they're making in their future.  He is a young man.  If he is going to win the support of the future generations of North Koreans who are going to be his power base, he's got to find a way to win their loyalty and this is part of that.""
Geoffrey See is a Singaporean who has been travelling back and forth to North Korea for the past seven years, working with young entrepreneurs. He says North Koreans are now thinking more innovatively about the economy:
""About six years ago when we first started our programme, our counterparts would often start off with a very long spiel about socialism and how this is the system they have and they are never going to change it.
""In recent years instead of saying that, people talk about... trying to bring in what's best from overseas, and try to adjust it to fit into the system.  So I think that's a very interesting change in terms of thinking.""
Where this new investment is being targeted is also interesting.
""If you look at the economic zones that North Korea was investing in, one of the key areas is Wonsan. So this is an economic zone on the east coast of North Korea.  It faces Japan and it borders South Korea.  So it is kind of almost the furthest location you can have from China. So we believe that it's part of this broader aim to balance off Chinese economic influence in North Korea.""
Kim Jong-un has also been making overtures to Russian President Putin. Two years ago, Russia wrote off 90% of North Korea's debt. But Geoffrey See says there aren't many foreign investors willing to engage with the country's idiosyncratic business environment:
""We would email the North Koreans two, three, four times and we [wouldn't] get a response, and we used to get very worried about it.  We wondered if they are reading our messages, if things are moving ahead.
""We would go in like three months later from the first set of emails.  When we meet with them we ask them, 'Did you receive our emails?' The response is always like, 'Oh, you are coming in three months' time, we didn't feel the need to send a response because we can just chat when you're back in here'.""
Kim Myong Chol was born and lives in Japan, but is ethnically Korean.
He has been to North Korea more than 20 times in the last 40 years, and says he has met representatives of the country's elite as well as, in his words, the two Kims - Kim Jong-un's father and grandfather. He hasn't met the third Kim yet, but praises his ""guts, determination and intelligence"".
The Inquiry: What does Kim Jung-un Want? was broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesday 27 January 2015.

Some describe Kim Myong Chol as an unofficial spokesman for the leader.
""What makes him different from the two Kims,"" he argues, ""is that he will succeed in getting what he wants. The reunification of Korea, without foreign interference.  Eventually the US will leave Korea and the Korean peninsula will be re-unified.
""[The US will] realise the futility, the senselessness of American military presence in Korea. North Korea [will] become too strong for America. We have now nuclear weapons, we have intercontinental ballistic missiles, we have hydrogen bomb.
""We are victims of American aggression. North Korea is a most sanctioned country. Brutalised, criminalised, isolated by America.""
He insists Kim Jong-un's unpredictable behaviour is part of his strategy to fight back:
""North Korea is a very small country. The USA is a big country with nuclear weapons.  How to defeat the enemy? Outsmart them. That's the only way North Korea can survive, outsmart America.""
Yanmei Xie is senior China analyst for the International Crisis Group in Beijing.
She argues that Kim Jong-un can do little without China's support.
""North Korea relies on China for survival. If China cut the fuel supply across the Yarlu River which is between North Korea and China, then the regime... will collapse in a matter of weeks. So Beijing plays a very crucial and vital role in the Korean Peninsula.""
And when North Korea does something that China doesn't like, its punishment is swift and exact:
""When there were reports and intelligence saying North Korea could be on the brink of a fourth nuclear test, China slowed down fuel supply and food aid.
""But before it did that, China looked into the fuel supply and harvest of grain and calculated the amount of reduction in order to make sure that the reduction would not cause instability. [This] was meant to send a signal of displeasure but not to destabilise the regime or cause real pain.""
This is because China also needs its neighbour: North Korea stands between China and the 28,000 US soldiers stationed in South Korea.
""North Korea used to be a military buffer for China in terms of heading off any potential advance of US armies. Now in the age of naval and air dominance of United States, a land war is not as important, but North Korea remains a political buffer in that it is a buffer between China and South Korea, which remains a US ally.
""So China shares interest of managing Kim Jong-un. But I think sometimes people confuse that with signs that China is ready to abandon the Kim Jong-un regime. But actually it's the opposite. China is... stabilising the regime... to prolong, to preserve the current status quo.""

"He died on Monday, aged 89, in a nursing home in Newmarket-on-Fergus in County Clare, following an illness.
Bishop Casey resigned as Bishop of Galway following the revelation he had been making payments to a woman in the United States for a long period.
He had a relationship with an American divorcee and was the father of her son.
Peter Murphy was born in 1974 and was the result of Bishop Casey's affair with Annie Murphy.
Speaking on BBC's Evening Extra programme, Michael Kelly of The Irish Catholic newspaper described the event as ""the beginning of the end of the extreme dominance of the Catholic Church in Irish public life"".
When the relationship became public in 1992, Bishop Casey resigned his post and went to America.
He later moved to Mexico to learn Spanish, worked as a missionary priest in Ecuador and then worked in a parish in England before retiring to Galway 14 years later.
In 2006 he came home to live in Shanaglish, near Gort, County Galway, and then Carrigoran Nursing Home in County Clare in 2011.
Born in County Kerry on 24 April 1927, Bishop Casey was educated in Limerick and in Saint Patrick's College, Maynooth, from where he was ordained to the priesthood in 1951.
For the next nine years he worked as a curate in two Limerick city parishes before being appointed to the Irish Emigrant Chaplaincy Service in England.
He became well-known while working in London for sourcing adequate housing for thousands of Irish emigrants.
On Monday, the Catholic Church said ""his passionate advocacy for social justice and for those marginalised by inequality gave him a significant public profile and his work in this area continued throughout his life"".
He was appointed Bishop of Kerry in 1969 before taking on the larger and more high-profile diocese of Galway and Kilmacduagh in 1976.
""Perhaps the highlight of his time in Galway was his organising and hosting the visit of Pope John Paul II to the city in 1979 to meet and pray with 300,000 young people from all over Ireland,"" the Catholic Church said.
Bishop Casey was present at the funeral of his murdered friend Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador when the liturgy was interrupted by bombs and intense gunfire which left almost 50 mourners dead.
He also voiced strong objections to the visit of US President Ronald Regan to Galway in 1984 because of ""American foreign policy"".
Archbishop Eamon Martin said:  ""It is with great sadness that I learned today of the death of Bishop Eamonn Casey.
""I wish to sincerely acknowledge the contribution of Bishop Casey to the work of the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference over twenty-three years during his time as Bishop of Kerry and as Bishop of Galway"".","Former Bishop of Galway, Eamon Casey, who was at the centre of a scandal that rocked the Catholic Church in the early 1990s, has died."
"Shipping containers are a common feature of the Kenyan landscape.
You'll find these steel boxes converted into comfortable homes, clinics and offices.
Others are turned into shops and granaries to store farm products.
But now shipping containers have entered the sphere of learning.
Starting this year, national examinations materials will be stored in secure shipping containers and placed under 24-hour armed police surveillance.
This is just one of the many new tough measures that the government is introducing to curb cheating in national exams.
In a country where people often rely on well-connected relatives and friends to succeed, education is everything.
Such is the thirst for personal development that around 20:00 on weekday evenings, you'll find the streets of Nairobi and other urban centres teeming with people of all ages going home from class.
Evening classes are a popular way for Kenyans to acquire a second or third degree with the hope of rising higher in life.
Competition for promotion or for the few job opportunities that become available is intense, leading to a desperate desire for more and better academic qualifications.
Joseph Warungu:
""There is a crisis of trust in Kenyan society.""
This pressure to succeed starts at primary school.
As a result, cartels have emerged to take advantage.
Working with some of the former national examinations council officials, police officers and teachers, these cartels have found a way to get hold of exam papers and sell them to desperate students and parents.
But last year things got out of hand as the cheating reached industrial proportions.
More than 5,000 primary and secondary school students had their exam results cancelled; the national examinations board was disbanded and some senior managers fired.
Nearly 200 people including police officers were arrested and charged over exam malpractices.
There is a crisis of trust in Kenyan society.
The government cannot trust the teacher to prepare the students for exams without cheating.
The teacher cannot trust the government to oversee the exams without cheating.
The student cannot trust himself to pass the exam without cheating.
And so in comes the tough steel containers to try and safeguard trust.
This year the government is not taking any chances.
By the time national exams begin in November, invigilators will have been vetted afresh.
Head teachers will now be held personally liable for any incidents of cheating that occur in their schools because they will have the sole responsibility of collecting from, and returning, the exam materials to the containers at central distribution points.
The government is so confident of the measures it has taken that the cabinet secretary for education gave this warning:
""I want to tell all children in candidate classes, that they better prepare for the exams. The monkey business that has been going on shall never happen again"".
But education is not the only sector suffering from the trust deficit.
Governance is badly hit.
Recently, a group of more than 30 elected County Assembly members, who were planning to impeach their Nyeri county governor in central Kenya, decided to spend the night inside the County Assembly under police guard, fearing that their opponents would kidnap them to frustrate the motion.
And in the last few days news has emerged of an invention to help curb drink driving.
The device, developed by a young university student, has an inbuilt breathalyser that detects the driver's alcohol level.
If it's too high, the device transmits a signal and prevents the engine from starting.
So why the need for such a device?
Road accidents kill an average of 3,000 people a year in Kenya and many of the accidents are caused by speeding and drink driving.
The government doesn't trust drivers not to get behind the wheel while drunk, and so it introduced alcohol breathalysers operated by traffic police.
But the public does not trust the police, because they can be easily bribed.
And the drunk driver does not trust anyone else to drive him home safely, except himself.
And so enter the Alcohol and Sound Detection System being developed by a young Kenyan.
It would be far cheaper and more effective to transform the Kenyan mind from within.
Instead the focus is on the symptoms of the epidemic:
If they cheat in exams, lock up exam materials in steel containers.
If democracy is in danger, hide it in locked chambers.
If the driver is too drunk to drive, let the car talk to him.
I think I'll now just retire to my shipping container house and trust that society will sort itself out.
