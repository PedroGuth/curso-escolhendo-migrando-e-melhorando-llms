The trial was told Mrs King's severe dementia had worsened in the months before her death and her husband had Alzheimer's and another mental health condition called paraphrenia which affected his ability to form judgements.
King, of Cedar Close, Walton-on-the-Naze, denied murder at an earlier hearing, but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
During the trial, the jury heard King also considered shooting his older sister Eileen, who is a resident at the care home, as well as himself.
Mr King was sentenced to six years for manslaughter, five years for firearm possession and 12 months for possessing ammunition. All three terms will be served concurrently.
The judge ordered he be treated for his mental health condition at a secure hospital unit in Northampton.
Consultant psychiatrist James Warner said paraphrenia was an older person's version of schizophrenia in which people lose contact with reality.",An 87-year-old man who shot his wife dead at a care home has been sentenced to six years in prison.
"Scottish winger Matt Williams' early touchdown caused shudders round a soaking wet Sixways.
But the home side responded with four tries, allied to 18 points from the boot of stand-off Ryan Lamb.
Flanker Sam Lewis scored a hat-trick of tries, while winger Dean Hammond also crossed the whitewash.
Lamb kicked three of his four conversion attempts, as well as two key first-half penalties - and two more late in the game.
Full-back Peter Lydon got the Exiles' other try, which he converted, along with a first-half penalty for a 10-point haul.
Scottish trailed by five points from Saturday's first leg, only for that advantage to be wiped out inside the first six minutes.
Jamie Stevenson's blindside run set up right wing Williams to score in the corner.
But that turned out to be the nearest this contest got to a Scottish gain as Warriors eventually rallied and started to tick the right boxes.
Two Lamb penalties in the space of three minutes were followed by a Sam Lewis pushover try in the left corner, from which Lamb was also successful with the conversion.
Peter Lydon did reduce the deficit at the interval to 13-8 with a penalty, but two tries in four minutes at the start of the second half killed the contest.
All Blacks winger Cooper Vuna, switched to full-back following an early injury to Ben Howard, set up Hammond, converted by Lamb before Lewis crashed over in the right corner, from which Lamb missed his first kick of the night.
Lydon converted his own try to bring it back to 25-15 on the night, before Lewis's third try, again converted by Lamb.
Lamb landed two more penalties before injury-weakened Warriors brought the biggest roar of the night with the late introduction of 17-year-old schoolboy Jamie Shillcock at scrum-half.

"Joe Lawton, 17, shot himself at his family farm in Greater Manchester two days after his arrest.
His parents, Nick and Jane Lawton, are urging the Government to change the law, which says 17 year-olds are not children in custody.
The Home Office believes current laws are adequate.
Joe was arrested when police stopped him as he drove his new car home from a party last August.
He was kept overnight at Cheadle Heath police station in Greater Manchester without his parents' knowledge because he was not classed as a child.
Two days later he took his own life, using a shotgun from the family farm. The police charge sheet was at his feet when his father found him.
Joe's parents believe they could have given him more support had they been able to see him in a police cell.
In a statement on the change.org website, Mr and Mrs Lawton said: ""He was just 17 and had made a bad decision to drive home after a party. Two days later Joe took his own life.
""We were not called when he was arrested or given the opportunity to give him the support he needed.""
They added: ""The fact that a 17-year-old is treated as an adult whilst in custody is an anomaly of British law.  Once they are charged they are then treated as children. This simply does not make sense.""
""We believe if the law had been different Joe would still be alive.""
A Home Office spokesman said: ""We believe the laws in place ensure the appropriate level of care for everyone, including 17-year-olds.""",The parents of a boy who killed himself after being arrested for drink-driving arrest are calling for 17-year-olds to be treated as children in custody.

"It said such a move would ""reduce the burden"" on passengers who could instead go to claims companies which would take a cut of any payouts.
Hundreds of flights were grounded by last Saturday's IT problems.
BA said that it had ""no desire to be obstructive"" and would fully honour its compensation obligations.
The problems, which continued throughout last weekend, disrupted the travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers around the world.
Under EU law, passengers can claim compensation from BA for travel disruption, worth up to 600 euros (Â£524).
They can also claim expenses for items such as hotels, meals and phone calls - a matter that led to a dispute with insurers during the week.
Which? said the airline sector was out of step with other service industries.
In a letter to BA chief executive Alex Cruz, Alex Neill from Which? wrote: ""You have 'profusely' apologised to passengers, many of whom have had their holidays ruined, and have 'committed' to following the rules on compensation.
""This does not go far enough and is simply not good enough. You have failed your customers once and are in grave danger of doing it again.
""By simplifying the compensation process, you have an opportunity to minimise the additional stress and inconvenience you cause your customers and ensure they are not pushed into the arms of claims management companies, who will take a large part of the money they are owed.
""British Airways can, and should, seek to automatically issue statutory compensation to all affected passengers.
""This would reduce the burden on passengers and mean they get back what they are legally entitled to quicker.
""It would also allow you to focus on dealing with the individual additional expenses incurred by affected passengers on a case-by-case basis.
""Disruptions like last weekend only highlight that it is time for all airlines to introduce measures so that, where possible, passengers are compensated automatically for delays and cancellations.""
A BA spokeswoman said: ""We sincerely apologise for the difficulties and frustration customers faced during the huge disruption across the bank holiday weekend.
""We will fully honour our EU compensation obligations and have set up a link on the home page of our website to enable customers to submit their claims as quickly and conveniently as possible.
""We have no desire to be obstructive in any way and have put additional resources into our call centres to process claims as speedily as possible.""
According to one comparison website, an estimated 70% of all airline customers who have a right to a payout do not claim.
Virgin became the first rail company to automatically compensate some train passengers if they are delayed.
Travellers using its services on the West Coast main line - and who book their tickets via the company app or website - receive automatic repayments.
Communications regulator Ofcom is also investigating the use of automatic compensation when phone or internet services fail.
At present, customers tend to go through one of two ombudsman services.","British Airways should automatically compensate thousands of customers who were caught up in disruption last weekend, says consumer group Which?"
"Recep Tayyip Erdogan said voters had chosen stability following unrest.
With almost all ballots counted, state-run Anadolu news agency said the AKP had won 49.4% of the vote, with the main opposition CHP on 25.4%.
European observers have criticised the government for stifling media freedom.
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said violence, especially in the country's south-east, had also had a significant impact on the election.
Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) went further and denounced the entire process as ""unfair"".
President Erdogan hailed the result early on Monday, saying: ""The national will manifested itself on 1 November in favour of stability.""
But he also attacked media criticism of him and called for global recognition of the election result.
""Now a party with some 50% [of the vote] in Turkey has attained power... This should be respected by the whole world, but I have not seen such maturity.""

Lira strengthens after result
Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu will now begin the process of forming a new government.
Mr Erdogan called the second general election this year after his AKP lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in 13 years in June and attempts to form a coalition failed.
The pro-Kurdish HDP crossed the 10% threshold needed to claim seats in parliament, but it got 21 fewer MPs than in June's election.
The nationalist MHP's share of the vote also declined, to 11.9%, and commentators suggested it had lost voters to the AKP.
Reported results also showed:
Clashes were reported in the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, in the south-east of Turkey, as the results were being counted. Reuters said police had fired tear gas at protesters throwing stones.
Since elections in June, a ceasefire between the Turkish army and militants from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has collapsed.
Critics have accused Mr Erdogan of renewing violence to curb support for the HDP - something the government denies.
In a statement on Monday, Ignacio Sanchez Amor, head of the OSCE observer mission, said: ""Physical attacks on party members, as well as the significant security concerns, particularly in the south-east... imposed restrictions on the ability to campaign.""
He added that pressure on journalists - including a police raid on the Koza-Ipek media group in Istanbul last week - was a major concern.
Meanwhile Andreas Gross, head of the PACE delegation, said: ""Unfortunately, the campaign for these elections was characterised by unfairness and, to a serious degree, fear.""
HDP co-chair Selahattin Demirtas said on Sunday that it had not been ""a fair or equal election"".
The party suspended campaigning after a bombing in Ankara last month killed more than 100 people. The government said the attackers were linked to the Islamic State (IS) group.
Violence has escalated in Turkey since a suicide bombing in July by suspected IS militants.
The attack near the border with Syria killed more than 30 Kurds.
Turkish newspaper front pages reflect the contrasting euphoria and gloom from government supporters and opponents at the election result.

"The England striker, 23, came through United's famed youth system but joined the Gunners for £16m on deadline day.
United brought striker Radamel Falcao on a £6m loan deal from Monaco, their sixth signing of the transfer window.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""They have probably lost the way of Manchester United a little bit,"" Phelan told BBC Sport.
""Now, rather than produce, it may be the case where they are buying in.
""Someone like a Danny Welbeck has been part of United's identity and that has been broken.
""What will happen in the future now, nobody knows but that thread has been broken now.""
Former United midfielder David Beckham said he was sad to see Welbeck leave, but is hopeful promising players will continue to be developed under new manager Louis van Gaal.
""Manchester United have always bought players in but also have had a great scouting system which Sir Alex Ferguson put in quite a few years ago, where we did create home-grown talent, and that is something we have done over the years,"" said the former England captain.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""I think Louis van Gaal is a talented manager, he is well respected and with Manchester United this is a project that will hopefully last for a few years and be a successful one.
""Hopefully we have still got young players coming through.""
For many years United had a strong core of home-grown youth players under former boss Ferguson, with the renowned 'Class  of 92' - which included Beckham, Paul Scholes and Phil and Gary Neville - coming through the ranks.
As well as Colombian Falcao, new boss Van Gaal has also brought in Angel Di Maria for a British-record £59.7m, midfielder Ander Herrera for £29m from Athletic Bilbao, left-back Luke Shaw in a £27m move from Southampton, the £16m Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon and midfielder Daley Blind from Ajax for £13.8m.
Meanwhile, United youngsters Tom Lawrence, Nick Powell and Michael Keane left on Monday, either on loan or permanently.
However, defender Tyler Blackett, a youth academy product, has played in the Premier League this season, while defender Reece James and goalkeeper Ben Amos have been included in the matchday squad.
But Phelan, who was Ferguson's assistant between 2008 and 2013, believes the big-money arrivals at Old Trafford could suggest a change of philosophy at the club.
""There is always the start of something and maybe this is the start of a new way of doing things at Manchester United and maybe that is the way football is going,"" he added.
""Is it better to look at the instant rather than the future? It is a difficult one because youth is always the future, we all have to start somewhere and you just hope that product of youth can develop in the Premier League.""
Phelan expects Arsenal to give Welbeck the chance to flourish after finding his chances limited at United.
Gunners boss Arsene Wenger already has a number of England internationals in his squad, with Jack Wilshere, Theo Walcott, Kieran Gibbs and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all first-team regulars when fit.
England squad member Calum Chambers was signed in the summer from Southampton and the defender has made three Premier League appearances this season.
""He is still only a young player and with young players you will get peaks and troughs but it is a case of Danny feeling more important in himself than he probably was over the last 12 months,"" added Phelan.
""He is in a position where he can play where he wants and I think that is why he chose Arsenal because they give him the opportunity to play in his best position, which is a striker.""","Former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan feels part of the club's ""identity has been broken"" with Danny Welbeck's departure to Arsenal."
"Thomas Scanlon, 23, attacked Jamie Bagnall with a piece of wood at a flat in Pensarn near Rhyl, Denbighshire, Mold Crown Court heard.
Scanlon, of no fixed abode but who had lived at Rhos-on-Sea, admitted wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm.
On Monday, he was jailed for four-and-a-half years.
Prosecuting barrister James Coutts said Scanlon was in a relationship with Mr Bagnall's sister. It was accepted Mr Bagnall had stolen an iPad from her, and the defendant had made a threat to ""get"" him.
The court heard that after the attack in March 2015, he posted the photograph of Mr Bagnall cowering on the floor on Facebook with a caption which read ""I am sorry, ha, ha, ha"".
Mr Bagnall, who has since moved to the Manchester area, needed surgery, had severe injuries including four deep cuts to the head and an injury to his elbow.
Owen Edwards, defending, said he appreciated that he had got himself into a huge amount of trouble.
Judge Niclas Parry told him: ""This was a revenge attack - a total over-reaction to a dispute between you and Mr Bagnall.""
A 10-year restraining order was made preventing him from contacting Mr Bagnall.",A man who attacked another man in a row over a stolen iPad and then posted a photograph of his injured victim on social media has been jailed.
"Ronan O'Mahony and James Cronin both notched two tries with Tommy O'Donnell and the Scannell brothers Niall and Rory also touching down for Munster.
Derick Minnie scored a first-half try for Zebre as Munster led 24-7 at the break with Lloyd Greeff also scoring for the Pro12's bottom club in Parma.
The Italian club have lost 16 of their 17 Pro12 matches this season.
Ireland hooker Niall Scannell finished off a maul to open Munster's account in the third minute before his fellow international O'Donnell extended the lead on 18 minutes.
After wing O'Mahony's first try, Minnie replied for Zebre on the half-hour mark before a Tyler Bleyendaal penalty left Munster 17 points clear at half-time.
Munster centre Scannell joined his older brother on the scoreboard with the first try of the second half to ensure his side a bonus point, before O'Mahony secured his brace after Marcello Violi was sin-binned for the hosts.
Despite their numerical disadvantage, Zebre reduced the deficit to 12 points through a converted try from South African Greeff with just under 25 minutes to play.

"Police said the 61-year-old man had left his own vehicle when he was struck by the lorry shortly after 13:00. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The eastbound carriageway was closed at Junction 3 while emergency services attended, but has since reopened.
Police said they were attempting to establish the full circumstances of the incident.",A man has died after being hit by a lorry on the M8 at Livingston in West Lothian.
"He was playing against opponents who, earlier that season, had wound him up so badly that it completely put him off his game. Players who 24 hours earlier had spoken to a newspaper to explain, in detail, how this imposter was going to be stopped.
The supporters didn't like him. Nothing was going right.
And then, taking possession 40 yards out, Ibrahimovic explodes.
A dart forward. The acceleration beginning. A quick stepover, round one opponent, speed increasing. Another stepover. Outside another, back inside the same man as he tries to recover and then a shot into the bottom corner from 18 yards.
""He could have passed,"" recalled one of the opponents he had left trailing in his wake. ""But he had read the article. It was as if he was saying, 'Forget it guys. It's me'.""
Ibrahimovic was not finished. Initial glee, wide smile, on bended knee, waving an arm in mock celebration to show how easy it was. Then something else, more serious, a point to be made. A cup-eared celebration, blowing kisses to the crowd who were already in a state of fury.
He was 19.
The goal is well known among Swedish fans. The reaction to it new.
It is part of a documentary 'Becoming Zlatan' to be released in August that contains remarkable archive footage of Ibrahimovic's early years at Malmo.
Getting such close access at an early stage of his career was sheer good fortune for brothers Fredrik and Magnus Gertten, who shot the footage in 2000 and 2001 as part of a film intended to show the conflict between young and older players at their beloved Malmo.
They needed a focus for each side of the debate. They had heard of Ibrahimovic and approached him.
""The way he saw it, of course we should make a documentary him,"" said  Fredrik.
""It suited his self image. He was only 17 but he had a very strong confidence that he would make it because he had something special.""
Manchester United's newest recruit has a reputation for saying what he thinks.
Numerous times in recent weeks he refused to say where he was going, even though his destination after leaving Paris St-Germain was obvious. Instead he said he amused himself by reading what was being written and would eventually let everyone know, at a time of his choosing.
He meant it. When he posted United's badge on Instagram, he even beat his new club to the news by 24 hours.
""We are not part of the football world,"" said Gertten. ""Our business is making social and political films. Our initial experience of dealing with footballers was that nothing of them ever comes out in what they say. Their words are controlled, boring, nothing.
""Zlatan was different. Here was a young guy who said interesting things, very honest things about himself and his emotions. It was so fresh. It made you feel warm towards him.
""The problem is people don't always like honesty. When someone says what they think it can be painful.""
His Croatian mother and hard-drinking Bosnian father were divorced and Ibrahimovic lived with the latter on the outskirts of town, moving regularly to earn the nickname 'gypsy',
His talent was honed on a small shale pitch outside his mum's flat. For him, football was, has been and remains fun.
As a teenager with Malmo, rather than simply beating opponents much older, he preferred balancing the ball on his foot and lifting it past them. To supporters it is magical. To opponents infuriating.
""I am just teasing,"" he said. ""If it's not fun it's not worth playing.""
Such arrogance does not come without a downside... there were times in his youth when Ibrahimovic seemed unmanageable.
Here was a kid, accepted by football people at Malmo as having the capability to become the best they had ever had, whose behaviour was so bad, even in the notoriously flexible world of football conduct, he nearly ended up without a club.
School was missed, regularly. He would spark fights in training with his poor discipline. It was the same in matches.
""He simply did not obey the rules,"" said Gertten.
""There was a really complex aura around him. He was over the top, aggressive. He did dirty things. Parts of the Malmo board wanted to kick him out of the club.""
When his mum and dad split, Ibrahimovic went to live with his dad, Sefik. His sister stayed with his mum.
The finer points of parenting were lost to Sefik. Frequently, there was beer in the fridge but no food.
In the documentary, Ibrahimovic explains with pride how he has learned to cook and fend for himself, all apart from his laundry, which he still took to his mum.
Yet, despite the hardship, the bond with his father is strong. The need to please obvious.
Remarkably though, Ibrahimovic's mum only found out her son was moving from Malmo to Ajax for a club record 8.7m euros in 2001 after seeing it on a television report. The teenager had asked his dad what he thought of the Dutch giants, but kept the news that discussions had already taken place a secret.
""There is a mystery around Zlatan which is hiding some part of him,"" said Gertten.
""It goes back to his childhood. You still love your mum and dad but the child who has a problem at home normally doesn't want to talk about it because they are trying to protect their family.
""His dad didn't watch him often but you could see what it meant to Zlatan any time he did.
""But his childhood also meant he had to make his own rules. He didn't have the same integration in society as others.""
If Ibrahimovic likes someone, the bond endures. However, if feelings go the other way, the dislike lingers.
Leo Beenhakker was the technical director at Ajax who took a chance on the Swede, and Ibrahimovic has never forgotten it.
Louis van Gaal followed him into the job. Ibrahimovic did not like it, or him. It is why, had Van Gaal remained at Old Trafford, there was no chance the 34-year-old would have moved to United.
Jose Mourinho (Inter Milan) good. Pep Guardiola (Barcelona) bad.
""If you treat him with respect he will treat you with respect,"" said Gertten. ""If you don't he will be a complicated man for you.""
Ibrahimovic's loyalty is underlined by the well-documented scissor-throwing incident involving Mido at Ajax in 2003.
After a defeat at PSV Eindhoven, the two got into an argument after Ibrahimovic accused Mido of not passing. In the heated exchange, the Egyptian, who had been cutting the tape from his socks, threw a pair of scissors which narrowly missed the side of the Swede's head.
Within 10 minutes, all had been forgiven and the pair were joking about it in a jacuzzi.
Ibrahimovic was the first person to publicly speak out for his friend. ""I made mistakes in Sweden,"" he said. ""It's a new day. You become older. You grow up.""
And then, to the television journalist posing the questions, he said: ""Have you made mistakes? Nobody is talking about them because you are only a reporter.""
We know so much about Ibrahimovic. But what do we really know?
In the documentary, as a teenager in Sweden, he speaks often about his girlfriend and the life they will have together in the Netherlands. She also thinks that is how it will be. Yet when he went to Amsterdam, she was hardly ever spotted at Ajax and one day he announced, glibly, that they had split.
Long hours were spent alone at his house in a small suburb of the Dutch capital - the kind of place perfect for a young family but completely at odds with the wild child image growing around him.
""I met him a lot during those early years,"" said Gertten.
""In the same year as Ibrahimovic made his debut for Malmo, the papers started with specialist sports sections. He was born for that. There were Zlatan headlines every week for a whole year even though Malmo were in the second division.
""In the beginning he was really flattered but suddenly the newspapers were doing conflict stories.
""When he got his driving licence he went to the area where the prostitutes were and pretended to be the police and scared away the customers. It was a practical joke. But it got headlines. That was shocking for him. He was upset about it.""
It is many years since Gertten and Ibrahimovic spoke. The player's advisors were told of the documentary. They did not obstruct its making, neither have they assisted.
The material, 15 years old, has been sifted through meticulously, most of it didn't make the cut. What did is compelling.
""I once read a book by a researcher who did work with kids who ticked all the boxes for someone who would go to prison,"" said Gertten. ""With the ones who didn't, one of the things that saved them was the ability to create positive emotions.
""In that sense, Zlatan's smile has been a lifesaver. The warmth that comes out of that smile makes people want to help him. They forgive him things that weren't too smart. That smile has a magic. It is really strong with him. He can turn everything around with a smile.""

"To give some idea of the amount of the currency that represents - there were more than 90 billion banknotes in circulation in India last March.
Most central banks destroy soiled and mutilated banknotes on a regular basis and replace them with new, crisp ones.
The Reserve Bank of India, similarly, shreds such notes and makes briquettes of them. But they are not your usual briquettes.
Briquettes - usually made of farm waste in India - are used for cooking, lighting and heating. They are cheaper than coal, have lower ash content, are less polluting, and easier to store and pack. They are mostly used as fuel in factory boilers.
But briquettes made out of shredded cash are brittle and serve no such purpose, a senior central bank official told me.
So the bank's 27 shredding and briquetting machines in 19 offices across India will now snip the expired banknotes into the smallest of pieces and the resulting briquettes will be then dumped in India's vast landfills.
Sometimes the shredded currency is also recycled to make files, calendars and paper weights and ballpoint pen shells, tea coasters, cups and small trays as souvenirs for guests.
The practice is similar in the US: counterfeit banknotes are sent to the Secret Service, while unfit notes are shredded and sent to landfills or given away as souvenirs to the public touring the Federal Reserve Bank.
Central bank officials believe shredding 20 billion banknotes will not be a huge challenge. In 2015-16 the Reserve Bank of India destroyed more than 16 billion soiled notes. More than 14 billion were removed in 2012-2013 after nearly 500,000 fake notes were found in the system.
""Destroying so much cash is not a challenge because we have enough shredding and briquetting machines with very high capacities. These are automatic machines which shred the cash into the finest of pieces,"" says an official.  So, India's mountain of expired currency will soon become rubbish, literally.","India's central bank will have to destroy, by one estimate, some 20 billion ""expired"" banknotes after it scrapped two high-value denominations - the 500 ($7.60) and 1,000 rupee notes - this month to crack down on ""black money"" or illegal cash holdings."

"Many researchers thought ministers would sit on this controversial issue. Instead, the chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, has announced that draft regulations will be published within months.
She predicts that couples affected by mitochondrial disease could benefit from the treatment within two years, enabling them to have healthy children.
So why is this such a significant moment?
Firstly the UK will become the first country to allow the technique, aimed at preventing a range of potentially deadly genetic disorders.
This will underline Britain's pioneering role in genetics and IVF stretching back to both the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 and the birth of Louise Brown, the world's first test tube baby, in 1978.
Secondly, the technique itself will result in babies with DNA from three people - two women and a man - and this genetic alteration will be passed down the generations.
Once babies have been born using this technique, there will be no going back. A permanent and novel genetic change to members of the human race will have been made.
That might sound pretty worrying, and talk of three people's DNA mixed together seems a bit ghoulish at first glance.  So is this science overstepping the mark?
A public consultation conducted by the fertility regulator, the HFEA, found there was broad support for the technique, once the details had been explained.
So let's look briefly at the science.
Mitochondria are the energy factories of cells. They contain a tiny bit of DNA and just 37 genes, sitting outside the nucleus which has more than 20,000 genes - including all the crucial genetic material from both parents.
Mitochondrial disorders are always passed down the maternal line in the egg, so the technique being pioneered by Prof Doug Turnbull and his team at Newcastle University involves using healthy donor eggs.
Put briefly, conventional IVF is performed and then, after fertilisation, the pro-nuclei of the father and mother - you can see them clearly as the two round balls inside the glass tube in the picture above - are sucked out of the developing embryo.
This leaves behind the faulty mitochondria. The parents' genetic material is then injected into a healthy donor egg which has had its pro-nuclei removed but still has healthy mitochondria.
The scientists believe the resulting embryo should develop normally. It means all the crucial parental genes will be retained, plus a tiny amount of DNA from the female donor.
So how much DNA from the second woman is there? There is 1.05 metres of DNA in the nucleus and 0.0054 mm of DNA in our mitochondria.
Let's put that another way.  If you imagine the DNA in your nucleus - remember this is all the important stuff which makes us what we are - and stretched it from Trafalgar Square to Prof Turnbull's laboratory in Newcastle, you'd have a double helix of 282 miles.
Now if you laid all the DNA from the mitochondria alongside it, it would stretch from Trafalgar Square, barely round the corner to the National Portrait Gallery - just a couple of hundred yards.  That perhaps gives you an idea of just how little DNA is involved.
The scientists in Newcastle say their technique is akin to changing the battery of a laptop computer. The hard-drive - containing all the important information - is the parental DNA in the nucleus which remains unchanged. The battery is simply the power source.
Animal research and a number of scientific reviews suggest the technique is safe. But the Newcastle team reckon they have another year or more research to do before they will be completely satisfied.
One limiting factor for the researchers is the shortage of healthy donor eggs. They need women in the Newcastle area who are prepared to altruistically donate their eggs.
Another team in Oregon is using a similar technique and is discussing future research with the American regulators.
The next step here will be the publication of draft regulations.
There will be a debate and a free vote in parliament. A final scientific review of safety will be made and then assuming all hurdles have been passed, it will be open to the Newcastle team to apply for a licence from the HFEA. Each case, each couple being treated, will require a separate licence.
But before then, further public debate is being actively encouraged - this is an occasion where science, ethics and regulation seem to be proceeding at the same pace.
There will be some who find this disturbing - tampering with nature. But for the families affected by mitochondrial disease it is a chance to have a healthy child, and to ensure that future generations are healthy too.
We may look back on this development as one of the key moments in science and ethics of modern times.",The decision of the government to support a ground-breaking technique for preventing serious genetic disease is a bold step for science and society.
"A man was arrested after the fires at Wasserstein and police suspect arson. No-one in the hostels was badly hurt.
More than a million refugees and migrants have arrived in Germany this year, and for most their first stop has been in Bavaria.
President Joachim Gauck devoted his Christmas message to the recent influx.
""We have shown what we are capable of, in terms of good will and professionalism, but also in the art of improvisation,"" he said, praising fellow Germans for their response to the crisis.
But he also called for the full force of the law to be used against anyone using violence against the new arrivals.
""Arson and attacks on defenceless people deserve our contempt and deserve punishment,"" the president said.
Refugee hostels in Germany have come under more than 200 attacks this year alone, according to research by Die Zeit newspaper, but the authorities have secured convictions against only a handful of attackers.
Migrant crisis explained in maps and graphics
Germany's 'historic test' - Merkel
Reports of Merkel's demise are greatly exaggerated
Year of the migrant - a crisis unlike all others
Chancellor Angela Merkel promised last week that Germany would ""noticeably reduce the number of refugees"" in response to criticism from within her centre-right CDU party.
Up to 40% of arrivals in Germany have come from Balkan countries such as Albania and Kosovo which are considered safe. Most of the other arrivals are refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
European countries have struggled to cope with the large number of people reaching the shores of the EU. This week, international migration officials said more than a million ""irregular"" migrants and refugees had come by land and sea, the vast majority via Greece.
Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka singled out Mrs Merkel for blame for sending out a signal across the Middle East and Africa which ""stimulated illegal migration to Europe"".
UN refugee officials say 3,716 people died or went missing this year as they tried to cross into Europe.
But there was good news for one Afghan family who feared their 10-year-son had drowned off the Turkish coast.
The Rabani family, who have since arrived in the German state of Lower Saxony, became separated from their son as they boarded a boat in Turkey. His boat capsized and many of those on board drowned.
A German Red Cross official eventually succeeded in tracking down the child, who was found staying at a refugee hostel in Switzerland. The family hope to be reunited in a few weeks' time.
In a separate development, a young Palestinian refugee who made headlines in July when she cried in front of Mrs Merkel has reportedly been told by German immigration officials that she and her family will be able to stay in the country until 2017.
Reem Sahwil, 14, had told the chancellor on live TV that she wanted to go to university but she burst into tears when the chancellor explained that not all migrants could stay in Germany and that politics ""can be tough"".
Mrs Merkel tried to comfort the girl by stroking her head.","Twelve people were hurt, including seven teenagers, when fires broke out at two neighbouring refugee hostels in the south German region of Bavaria."

City are now 10 points behind leaders Chelsea after defeat on Merseyside - the heaviest league loss in Guardiola's managerial career.
Asked if the gap was too great, he said: ""Yes. Ten is a lot of points.""
Guardiola, 45, has told his players to unite ""in the bad moments"" and ""forget the table"" until the end of the season.
He added: ""At the end of the season, we are going to evaluate our level and how our performance was, how the coach was, how the players were. After that we are going to decide.""
The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss insisted he was ""so happy in Manchester"" despite his side sitting fifth, two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal.
Guardiola watched City dominate possession on Merseyside but concede four from the six shots they faced.
Only five teams have a lower haul than their four clean sheets in the league - BBC Radio 5 live pundit Robbie Savage said City ""cannot defend"" and questioned if Guardiola would now change his style.
City are the only team in the Premier League to have over 50% of possession in every game this season but they have now conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their last seven games.
Guardiola added: ""I said to the players be positive because you made some fantastic things during the season and for many reasons we didn't get what I think we deserved.
""In the bad moments we have to be close. It's awful for my players. We created chances but don't score and when they have a chance, they punish us.""
Everton scored with their first two shots through Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas, with Tom Davies and Ademola Lookman completing the rout.
Lookman's goal came after a John Stones clearance was charged down, throwing the young defender again under the spotlight.
It was Stones' first visit to Goodison Park since leaving Everton for City in a £47.5m deal last summer.
The 22-year-old has been criticised for making too many mistakes, and former Manchester United and Everton defender Phil Neville believes he is being unfairly singled out.
However, fellow pundit Alan Shearer told Match of the Day 2: ""John Stones did have a nightmare. He is 22 now, he has played nearly 100 Premier League games and everyone keeps saying to me and to the rest of the football world, that he is going to be a top player.
""If I'm a centre forward, a young guy and I keep on missing chances, I don't expect to be in the team. Eventually you are going to get left out. I keep seeing Stones making mistakes too often, too many times.""

"But health officials have warned that unless MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations continue, a further outbreak cannot be ruled out.
There have been no laboratory-confirmed cases linked to the outbreak area since 22 May, Public Health Wales said.
One person died and a total of 1,219 measles cases were diagnosed during the outbreak since November.
Some 88 people visited a hospital due to the disease while a campaign was launched to boost the uptake of the MMR vaccine.
Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales (PHW), said that the end of the outbreak was in ""no small part to unprecedented efforts to vaccinate tens of thousands of people"".
""Without so many vaccinations being given, we know that the outbreak could have continued for many more months,"" said Dr Lyons.
But PHW warned that with 30,000 children in the 10 to 18 years age group still unvaccinated across Wales, there was still a possibility of a further outbreak in the future.
And the health minister urged parents to get their children vaccinated.
Dr Lyons said: ""The only reason this outbreak could happen was because not enough young people in Wales were fully vaccinated with two doses of MMR and there is absolutely no guarantee that this could not happen again.""
Some 75,868 unscheduled vaccinations were given to people around Wales who had not been immunised in a bid to bring the epidemic under control.
GP surgeries, hospital and schools held drop-in sessions, with PHW particularly keen to target children and young people who may have missed their scheduled jabs.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he ""wholeheartedly"" welcomed the end of the outbreak but insisted there was ""still work to do"".
""The young people in the 10 to 18 age group who still have not been vaccinated should make the necessary arrangements at their earliest convenience,"" he added.
""We would not want to see another outbreak.
""I would like to thank the healthcare professionals for their tireless work in organising and staffing the unscheduled vaccinations drop-in sessions and GPs for the contribution of primary care among others.""
Large numbers of children in the 10-18 age group were not given the MMR vaccine as babies, the result of a scare that caused panic among parents.
It followed research by Dr Andrew Wakefield in the late 1990s which linked the vaccine with autism and bowel disease.
His report, which was published in The Lancet medical journal, was later discredited, with health officials insisting the vaccine was completely safe.
PHW said that even though the outbreak was over, a small number of measles cases were seen in Wales every year - in 2011 there were 19 cases - and parents should still ensure their children were fully vaccinated.
The first dose of MMR should be given at around 12-13 months of age and the second at around three years and four months of age - but it is never too late to catch up on missed doses, say health officials.
PHW advises that anyone born in 1970 or later who has not had measles or two doses of MMR should be vaccinated.
Any babies younger than 12 months who were advised to receive early vaccination as a result of the outbreak will still be called for routine vaccination and should still attend these appointments.
It is not dangerous to receive more than two doses of the vaccine, PHW added.
The measles outbreak centred on the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg health board area - which covers Swansea and Neath Port Talbot - along with the Powys health board area and Hywel Dda, which covers Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion.
The Welsh Conservatives renewed their calls for a public inquiry into the epidemic so that lessons could be learned and failings identified.
On Monday, an inquest heard that Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, died from pneumonia after contracting measles during the Swansea outbreak.
He was found dead on his sofa in his flat on 18 April, days after seeing GPs and complaining of a rash all over his body.",The measles epidemic centred on the Swansea area has been declared over eight months after it began.

'Grandiose plan'
The concert was staged by the Moranbong band as its debut performance on Friday, reported state media KCNA.
The band was put together by Kim Jong-un, who has a ''grandiose plan to bring about a dramatic turn in the field of literature and arts this year"", state media said.
North Korean entertainment has traditionally featured nationalist or folk songs, and mass displays.
In recent years, reports say, children in the isolated country have become familiar with characters such as Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh through stationery items and clothes imported from China, North Korea's closest ally.
It seems to point to an easing of North Korea's paranoia about what it calls spiritual pollution from the West, and even more dangerously, South Korea, says the BBC's Charles Scanlon.
It is still illegal to watch South Korean television programmes in North Korea. But a recent report based on interviews with refugees said that North Koreans now have more access to outside media, especially DVDs of popular South Korean drama serials.

Part of the film studio's argument was that it should not need to change the name, citing EU law which states a trademark must be ""a sign"", in the sense of being a single sign and capable of being ""graphically represented"".  The show's name, it said, did not fall into this category.
As a result, the judges have asked the two parties and the UK Intellectual Property Office to enter their submissions on the issue by Monday when they will consider whether to send the case to the European courts.

"Earlier the Saudi foreign ministry said it had turned down the non-permanent seat, accusing the world body of ""double standards"".

It said the Security Council had failed in its duties towards Syria as well as in other world conflicts.
Mr Ban refused to say whether he would be speaking to the Saudi king about the matter.
""I understand that some member states, particularly some concerned group of member states, are discussing [this] among themselves,"" Mr Ban said.
The reaction among diplomats to this unprecedented decision has been one of shock and confusion, the BBC's Nada Tawfik reports from the UN.

""The fact is that the Security Council has been unable to act now for more than two years,"" Mr Araud said, according to AFP.
However, Russia's foreign ministry called the move bewildering, and said Saudi Arabia's criticism of the UN Security Council about its actions over Syria ""is particularly strange"".
By Bridget KendallDiplomatic correspondent, BBC News
Usually there is fierce competition to secure one of the 10 rotating seats on the UN Security Council - a chance to sit alongside the five permanent members for two years  on the top UN body which rules on international security issues.
Instead Saudi Arabia  has used the coveted position to lodge a very public protest.
This is the second protest from Saudi Arabia. Earlier this month the Saudi foreign minister pulled out of giving a speech at the UN General Assembly, expressing similar frustration.
It is a dramatic gesture, but whether it makes immediate reform of the Security Council more likely, as the Saudis demand, is probably questionable.
Saudi Arabia has previously expressed frustration at what it sees as an international failure to act on Syria, where it staunchly backs the rebels.
The announcement came hours after Saudi Arabia was elected for the first time to one of the 10 rotating seats on the Security Council.
The non-permanent members sit on the council for two years, along with the five permanent members - the US, the UK, France, China and Russia.
As well as accusing the council of ""double-standards"" and demanding reform, the Saudi foreign ministry pointed to its failure ""to find a solution to the Palestinian cause for 65 years"", which had led to ""numerous wars that have threatened world peace"".
It also criticised the UN's ""failure"" to rid the Middle East region of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons.
And it accused the UN of allowing the Syrian government ""to kill its own people with chemical weapons... without confronting it or imposing any deterrent sanctions"".
The UN Security Council last month finally broke a two-and-a-half year deadlock on how to deal with conflict in Syria after voting unanimously to adopt a binding resolution on ridding the country of chemical weapons.

"Cummings was in the right place at the right time to convert David Gray's cross for his first.
And the 21-year-old rolled in an opportunistic second from a tight angle when he capitalised on a mix-up in the Buddies' defence.
New signings Andrew Shinnie and Brian Graham both came off the bench to make their debuts for Hibs.
Graham in particular had a brilliant chance to score his first goal for the Leith side but Saints goalkeeper Scott Gallacher blocked the effort.
Former Buddie John McGinn cracked the angle of post and cross-bar late on and any critics of Cummings would say the forward should have gone home with a hat-trick ball.
His double here brought his tally for the season to five already, and the deflected cross from energetic captain Gray only needed a left-foot steer into the net.
Being in the right place to capitalise was key for Cummings, and 10 minutes later his persistence at pestering St Mirren defender Jack Baird and keeper Gallacher was rewarded.
The St Mirren duo left a back-pass to each other and Cummings nipped in to clinically score from a tight angle.
Lennon's managerial effect from the sidelines is clear. Fifteen minutes into this match the former Celtic boss was berating Hibs centre-back Darren McGregor for a lack of urgency.
Players paid attention to Lennon's demands to ""move it quickly"" and ""get it forward"".
Cummings received an earful for a poor second-half pass and Marvin Bartley was rebuked for moaning at the referee. Lennon has got his team by the scruff of the neck.
St Mirren's home form under Alex Rae has been better than his predecessors but there was not much for the locals to get excited about on this occasion - indeed some booed at half-time.
Baird watched his header sail over and substitute David Clarkson shot narrowly wide, but the impression was Hibs had another gear in them if required.
Hibs boss Neil Lennon: ""Jason Cummings is a goalscorer but there's more to his game.
""He got two brilliant goals and could've had a couple more. I thought he got sloppy in the second half and looked a little bit tired.
""If you'd been watching him in the first half you could have had Real Madrid on the phone. But if you'd been watching him second half you would've had Accrington Stanley on the phone - and that's no disrespect to Accrington.""
St Mirren manager Alex Rae: ""The fact is that we dug in and competed in the second half.
""You can't legislate for that second goal. No matter what the preparation is, it's just a miscommunication and it becomes difficult because you're chasing the game.

"Almost none of these will work. Why?
Because, on current polling, it all comes down to whether you think the people voting for Andy Burnham or those voting for Yvette Cooper are more likely to put Corbyn as their next preference.
And there is no decent publicly available evidence that either of them are. Furthermore, for similar reasons, there is no arithmetic reason why non Corbyn candidates withdrawing would do anything to stop Corbyn.
Voters in this election will be given the opportunity to rank the candidates in order of preference. The first preferences are counted up, and the person with the fewest is eliminated from the contest - and the votes they received are given to whoever each person that voted for them rated as their second preference.
If after that none of the candidates has achieved 50% of the vote, the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated and their votes are given to whoever they put as their higher preference amongst the two remaining candidates. By definition, this gives one of the two remaining candidates a majority of the votes.
Current polling puts Corbyn first, Cooper and Burnham roughly tied in second, and Kendall trailing in third. So either Cooper or Burnham will most likely be the candidate that faces Corbyn in the final round. If you want to stop Corbyn, you'll be voting for some combination of Cooper, Burnham and Kendall as your first three preferences. So your vote WILL end up being for whoever faces Corbyn in the final round, WHICHEVER order you put those three in.
The only way you can affect the number of votes Corbyn gets is by trying to second-guess the second preferences of people that vote for eliminated candidates. If you believe the polls, Kendall's almost certain to be eliminated first, so you can't affect that. But one of Burnham and Cooper won't be eliminated before the final run off with Corbyn. Whichever one is eliminated will have their preferences redistributed to either Corbyn or his opponent.
So, in theory, if you, the ""stop Corbyn"" voter thought that, say, Burnham's supporters are more likely to have Corbyn as their next preference than Cooper's, you should put Burnham ahead of Cooper in your preference list even if you ACTUALLY prefer Cooper to Burnham - because it'll starve Corbyn of the extra votes he'd get if Burnham was knocked out.
The thing is, I am not aware of any decent evidence that this is the case. We have very few polls on the Labour leadership election - and those that exist (necessarily) have small samples of what Burnham and Cooper's second preferences would be. Very roughly speaking, the polling tables I've seen suggest supporters of both split their second preferences about 30/70 between Corbyn and his opponent. So it's not clear which of these you should give a higher preference to tactically stop Corbyn anyway.
In other words, there is no obvious way to tactically vote against Corbyn. If you want to stop him he'll be your last preference anyway - and it literally doesn't matter what order your first three preferences are in. Crazy thought though it might be, you can happily vote for candidates on the basis of, y'know, how good you think they are.
This actually has implications for people dropping out of the race as well. Ballot papers have already gone out, but Cooper could, for example, tell all her supporters to first preference Andy Burnham instead. In terms of tactical voting, there is NO POINT in any of the three non Corbyn candidates doing this. All their votes will be aggregated to support whoever faces Corbyn in the final round anyway as a result of the preference system.
Of course, that's just on the arithmetic. There might be a case for candidates dropping out if they think that a unified anti-Corbyn campaign would be more effective at winning over existing Corbyn supporters - perhaps because they spend less time attacking each other. But this is necessarily pretty speculative, especially this late in the game.

"Charlton had thrashed Rovers 5-1 at the Memorial Stadium in November and they were convincing victors again, although they had to do it the hard way after a mistake by Patrick Bauer gifted Rovers a 12th-minute lead.
The Addicks defender slipped while attempting a back pass, enabling Jermaine Easter to burst clear on goal and round Dillon Phillips before slotting into an empty net.
Magennis' free-kick hit the crossbar, while Adam Chicksen's cross was tipped behind by Will Puddy via the woodwork as Charlton sought an equaliser before the break.
Parity was restored four minutes before the interval with Magennis heading home from Joe Aribo's free-kick.
And the duo combined in almost identical circumstances five minutes into the second half, an unmarked Magennis again using his head to convert from Aribo's set-piece delivery.
Aribo turned provider once again just after the hour, playing a low ball across the face of goal which was swept in from close range by Jorge Teixeira to make it 3-1.
Magennis completed his treble after 73 minutes, latching on to Andrew Crofts' pass and then firing an angled shot beyond Puddy in some style.

""I know the trauma and the anguish you must be going through.""
He was interrupted by a member of the public knocking on the window of the public gallery.
The judge asked them to leave the court and for people to ""respect the rule of law"" in a case where ""emotions are flying high"".
During the short hearing, Mr Casey spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth.
He did not enter pleas but the court was told he was likely to do so when the case is next heard.

Although the president-elect will not go to Davos, one of his top advisers - hedge fund boss Anthony Scaramucci - will speak about the new US leader's plans on Tuesday.
Mr Trump, whose ""America first"" pledge helped him win the White House, has also threatened to hike tariffs on goods imported from China.
Mr Xi is taking China's biggest delegation to the elite gathering in Davos, and his appearance is seen as an attempt to present the country as a world leader.
His entourage includes some of China's most successful business people, such as Jack Ma, the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, and property magnate Wang Jianlin, who runs the conglomerate Dalian Wanda.
China's vice foreign minister Li Baodong has said Mr Xi will detail the country's views on how to ""steer economic globalisation towards greater inclusiveness"".
Despite the apparent hostility between the US and China, Mr Xi has spoken of a smooth communication channel with Mr Trump's team, and reports suggest the Chinese president would be willing to meet members of the US president-elect's team whilst in Davos.
Mr Xi's attendance has been welcomed by WEF founder Klaus Schwab, who said he expects him to ""show how China will assume in global affairs a responsive and responsible leadership role"".
Responsive and responsible leadership is the theme for this year's gathering, which comes after a year of dramatic events including the UK's Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump.
Mr Schwab has called on attendees to help ""overcome the present mood of divisiveness and negativism"".

"The source close to the inquiry played down the significance of the interviews carried out in Portugal on Tuesday.
Portuguese detectives in Faro were observed during the questioning by officers from the Met Police, which is conducting its own investigation.
Madeleine disappeared aged three in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz in 2007.
The source told the BBC: ""Questioning of the four suspects was concluded yesterday evening. Unfortunately the interviews have led to no new developments and we are back where we were seven years ago.""
The source added: ""The 'arguido' [suspect] status was given to the suspects to protect them. It gives them legal rights including the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present during interviews.
Jeremy Cooke, BBC News in Praia da Luz
It is clear that the latest developments in the Madeleine McCann case are the result of the detailed, painstaking work being done by British police officers working on Operation Grange.
As their investigation continues, they formally request assistance from the Portuguese police. It is at the request of Scotland Yard officers that four potential new suspects - or arguidos - and 11 potential witnesses are being interviewed.
Those interviews involve detectives from both countries; the Portuguese asking the questions, while the British monitor proceedings.
It is not clear what potential link the British team believe may exist between the ""suspects"" and the disappearance of the three year-old. But clearly there are lines of inquiry they believe are worth following up.
There are, however, clear tensions here. With one source close to the case saying that the investigation is going nowhere and ""we are back where we were seven years ago"".
""They were declared arguido due to being identified as suspects in a letter of international request sent by the British to the Portuguese authorities.""
The Portuguese Attorney General's Office in Lisbon issued a brief statement about the questioning of the four suspects.
It said that requests from the British authorities had been carried out but the content of these requests would remain confidential.
Police have begun the process of interviewing 11 witnesses, which also relates to official requests from the Metropolitan Police.
The source indicated that two tracker dogs from the UK could be used in searching a vehicle thought to belong to one of the witnesses. No time or location was given for this.
One of the four ""persons of interest"" - or arguidos - questioned was Sergey Malinka. He has always denied any involvement.
Mr Malinka, a Russian-born website designer with Portuguese nationality, was questioned as a witness in 2007 when Madeleine went missing.
On Tuesday, Mr Malinka and another suspect left the central police station in Faro after they were interviewed.
A third person, who is said to be suffering from severe schizophrenia, remained inside the police headquarters after the other two had left.
All of those being questioned are Portuguese citizens. They have all been summoned to be interviewed; there have been no arrests.
The status of arguidos in the Portuguese judicial system refers to individuals whom police may reasonably suspect are linked to a crime.
In June, Portuguese and British officers searched three sites in Praia da Luz but found no evidence relating to the case.
Scotland Yard said at the time that ""more activity"" had been agreed with Portuguese police and the searches were the ""first phase"" of a major investigation.
The McCann family - from Rothley, Leicestershire - were staying in an apartment in Praia da Luz when Madeleine was last seen.
Her parents had been at a restaurant near their apartment when she went missing.","Questioning of four suspects in the Madeleine McCann investigation has concluded without any new developments, a source has told the BBC."
"The former Sierra Leone tactician was dismissed on Thursday after 15 months in-charge of Amavubi.
McKinstry said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" and the reasons ""had not been made fully clear"" to him.
McKinstry took over the Rwanda job from Englishman Stephen Constantine who stepped down in March 2015.
The Northern Irishman then led Rwanda to the quarter final stage of the 2016 Africa Nations Championship that they hosted.
He also led the team to the runner-up spot in the 2015 Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
""The specific reasons behind the decision have not been made fully clear to me given our performance to date, I am therefore both surprised and disappointed by the announcement today, and that myself and the team will not be able to finish what we started,"" he said.
The 30-year old coach managed to record 11 wins, two draws and a dozen defeats in the 25 games he was in charge of Rwanda.
According to the Rwanda FA, McKinstry was sacked because he did not achieve some of the targets that had been set for him.

Pearson, back in management following his sacking by Leicester in June 2015, won the Championship title with the Foxes in 2013-14.
Derby County boss Nigel Pearson:
""I was very pleased with our determination and the fact that the players kept on trying to function as a team. Although we weren't playing at our best and didn't use the ball as well as I would have liked to have done, we worked really hard to protect our own goal.
""We had some very good chances early on, we started the first half very well and they started the second half very well.
""What's important for me with this performance and this result is that if people have the opinion that in the past we may have lost, I was interested and very pleased to see our players work so hard to not allow a tight game to go to the opponents.
""You've got to try and win games but if you can't win them you don't lose them and I think both managers would be saying very similar things.""
Brighton & Hove Albion manager Chris Hughton:
""I think in the last few years a draw here is going to be a very good result. I thought although we needed David Stockdale to make a couple of very good saves, we edged the chances.
""I thought we had the better of the chances but I thought on the balance of play a draw was probably a fair result. I think what you have with Glenn [Murray] is a player who will be a wonderful signing for us but he's come in on the back of a season last year when he didn't have too many starts.
""But he's a worker for the team so my delight with him is how he's got into those positions and if he does that enough times over a season he will score goals.
""Generally you don't know what you are going to get first game of the season but I thought the application of the team was excellent and apart from winning and goals I think I've got everything I wanted today.""

"A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth.
The proposal to allow abortion in such cases was defeated by 59 votes to 40.
The result followed a passionate debate at Stormont after some MLAs proposed the law change be introduced by way of an amendment to the Justice Bill.
Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland.
Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health.
Politicians have been lobbied to reform the law since 2013, when Northern Ireland woman Sarah Ewart spoke out about having to travel to Great Britain for an abortion after she was told she was carrying a baby that had no chance of survival.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) faced criticism from other parties during Wednesday's debate for asking the Health Minister Simon Hamilton to set up a working group to examine the issues raised by fatal foetal abnormality.
It could take six months for the group to complete its work and the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt claimed it was a DUP ""device"" to delay decision making on abortion reform until after May's assembly election.
Justice Minister David Ford, who brought forward the proposed change to the legislation, told Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show it could now remain in limbo for some time.
""It would appear that that is what some people want, that it was any excuse at all to avoid taking a decision last night so they can fudge the issue,"" he said.
""We will wait and see what happens to the DUP's supposed working group for the next six months. Certainly, we'll get the DUP past the election, maybe that's why they're doing it.""
However, the DUP has argued that the issue required proper consideration by MLAs and ministers and that the Justice Bill was not intended for this purpose.
The amendment to legalise abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality was proposed by Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson.
He told MLAs: ""If we are to continue to fail women in Northern Ireland in this area then we are abdicating our duties as representatives.
""The traumatic journey to England for many young women is becoming a shame on Northern Ireland and to force women with a fatal foetal pregnancy to look elsewhere for help and support make this worse.""
The amendment relating to pregnancies which are the result of rape or incest was put forward by Anna Lo, also of the Alliance Party, and was defeated by by 64 votes to 30.
Mr Nesbitt said that as a man he did not feel comfortable ""discussing what a woman should do with her body"" but he added that MLAs had a responsibility to legislate.
He claimed the DUP's request for a commission was a delaying tactic designed to ""kick the decision to the far side of the election"".
Mr Nesbitt described the delay as ""cruel"" and ""Dickensian"".
""This is Bleak House we're in today, in the Chancery courts waiting day after day, after day, after day for a decision that never comes,"" he said.
Sinn Féin MLA Caitríona Ruane also criticised the DUP for ""supporting a commission which will report in six months"".
""What about the plight of women in the here and now? What about the women who are pregnant as the result of rape, or women who are faced with fatal foetal abnormalities?
""Is the DUP going to tell them 'we're having a commission in six months and sure, then we'll see where is goes?'  I'm sorry, long-fingering this does a disservice to women,"" Ms Ruane said.
However, Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MLAs expressed doubt that doctors could accurately predict that an unborn child had no chance of survival.
SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said clinicians had told her party that ""there is no such definition"" as fatal foetal abnormality.
Speaking independently from her party, Alliance MLA Anna Lo proposed that women who have become pregnant as a result of sexual crime should have access to a legal abortion in Northern Ireland.
Ms Lo said that forcing pregnant rape victims to give birth meant they would be ""reminded every day of that act of violence which was forced upon her"".
However, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister described Ms Lo's amendment as a  ""charter for abortion on demand"".
He said that because of his background as a barrister he had more experience than most MLAs of rape trials and added that ""95% of the time, the question for the jury is - was the sexual intercourse consensual or not?""
""All you have to do is to allege indecent assault it seems, rape, and you're entitled on the nod of a medical practitioner to abortion,"" he said.
Mr Allister told MLAs that allegations of rape could only be proven through ""due process"" and this was not possible within the timeframe of pregnancy.
DUP MLA Emma Pengelly spoke in support of the working group on fatal foetal abnormality.
""I have not had the beautiful privilege to have brought a child into this world but I can empathise with all my heart that the wished for, the longed for, can turn so quickly to tragedy,"" she said.
""The way forward that we are proposing is a compassionate one, it is a sensible one, it is a common sense one that will leave all of us in a much better and informed position to chart a loving and kind way forward.""
At the end of the debate, Assembly Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin commended MLAs on the ""sense of dignity"" they displayed during the discussions.
Stormont's chief legal adviser, Attorney General John Larkin QC, is among those who are opposed to changing the law and has outlined concerns that the move could breach obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).
Precious Life, one of the largest pro life organisations in the region vowed to ""expose"" any MLA who voted in favour of the new legislation.
Amnesty International said failing to reform the law would be a ""betrayal of women"", while the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission urged political action.",Northern Ireland Assembly members have voted against legalising abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.
"The spacecraft, which takes visible and infrared pictures of the Earth, was launched in June and is now undergoing a period of commissioning.
The observer is the second dedicated mission to fly in the European Union's Copernicus programme.
This will see a multi-billion-euro series of satellite sensors put in orbit over the next few years.
Sentinel-2a, however, will be the system's backbone, producing a wide range of imaging products that will focus predominantly on the planet's land surface.
The European Space Agency, which led the development of the platform, released a taster on Monday of what to expect.
These views ranged from cities and forests to glaciers and coral reefs.
""They are stunning,"" said mission manager Bianca Hoersch.
""Okay, we still have some calibration work to do, on co-registration between visible and shortwave infrared bands, but I think you can see just from this release that the quality is going to be really excellent.""
Sentinel-2a is the European equivalent of America's Landsat mission, which has been imaging the surface of the Earth for 40 years.
The US satellite's data is free and open, which has driven a multitude of applications. Most people will probably know it best from the map tools they use on their computers and smartphones. These all incorporate Landsat pictures.
Sentinel's data has been designed to be complementary, but the platform also represents a big jump in capability.
Its imaging instrument will be sensitive across more bands of light (13 versus Landsat's eight), allowing it to discern more information about the land beneath it; and Sentinel-2a will ""carpet map"" a much wider strip of ground (290km versus 185km).
In addition, its colour images have a best resolution of 10m, versus Landsat's 30m.
Given that today, non-specialist use of Earth imagery overwhelmingly relies on Landsat data, it is more than probable that Sentinel products will be in big demand.
The European Commission will be using Sentinel pictures in its Copernicus programme to run variety of services, reaching across agriculture and forestry, urban planning and disaster mitigation.
Agriculture, though, is certain to be a big user. The satellite's camera sensor has been designed to detect very specific wavelengths of light that detail the health of plants.
In normal operation, Sentinel-2a will be producing 1.7 terabytes of processed data per day. And this will double when the sister satellite, Sentinel-2b, is launched next year.
""The data volume is incredible,"" Dr Hoersch told BBC News.
""Of course, we all knew it would be like this, but when you sit there with your computer and try to download it, it's massive - gigabytes of data.  I had to go out at the weekend and buy a hard disk to store all these products for my presentations.""
Esa will launch Sentinel-3a at the end of 2015. This satellite is dedicated to observing the oceans.

"The reforms are thought to include tax rises and pension changes.
Greece is due to present the proposals by 22:00 GMT on Thursday to try to secure a third bailout and prevent a possible exit from the eurozone.
The new proposals will be studied by eurozone finance ministers on Saturday and a full EU summit on Sunday.
Defence Minister and junior coalition party leader Panos Kammenos gave no further details of the agreed plans as he left the prime minister's official residence, where ministers had been meeting.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has spent the day discussing the proposals with his cabinet.
Greek media are reporting that the reforms will be put to the Greek parliament on Friday for approval.
On Wednesday Greece formally submitted a request for an unspecified loan from the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund.
This would be a fresh loan ""to meet Greece's debt obligations and to ensure stability of the financial system"", Greece says - in other words, to avoid bankruptcy.
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, who will chair Sunday's EU summit, said he hoped to receive ""concrete and realistic proposals of reforms from Athens"".
Such proposals ""will have to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability from the creditors. Only then will we have a win-win situation,"" Mr Tusk added.
However the German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that ""a classic haircut"" (meaning reducing the value of Greece's debts) was ""out of the question"" for her.
All Greek to you? Debt jargon explained
Speaking in Sarajevo, Mrs Merkel said the eurozone had dealt with the issue of debt sustainability in 2012.
She described Sunday's EU summit as a decisive and important meeting.
""We must not forget that the Greek people are suffering at the moment,"" she said.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble also ruled out debt relief for Greece, saying ""there cannot be a haircut because it would infringe the system of the European Union"".
Greece needs to implement reforms to win the trust of its eurozone partners, Mr Schaeuble said. He told a conference in Frankfurt that his message to the new Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos was: ""Just do it!"".

The Greek government has meanwhile extended bank closures and the €60 (£43; $66) daily limit on cash machine withdrawals until Monday.
The curbs were imposed on 28 June, after a deadlock in bailout talks with creditors led to a rush of withdrawals.
Louka Katseli, the head of the Greek bank association, said on Thursday that there was enough liquidity in cash machines to serve the public until Monday.

On Thursday, EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said he was hopeful of a new deal: ""I have the sense that the dialogue is established, or restored, and that there is a way out.""
The IMF, lowering its economic growth forecast for the world for 2015, said events in Greece would have a ""limited"" effect on the rest of the global economy, as Greece makes up just 2% of the eurozone.
What happens next?
European Stability Mechanism explained
Greece's creditors - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF - have already provided more than €200bn in two bailouts since a rescue plan began five years ago.
The second bailout expired on 30 June.
The creditors had hoped for new, concrete proposals from Greece at a meeting on Tuesday but these were not submitted and they instead agreed to set a new deadline of Thursday.
Greece has been warned this is the ""final deadline"".
Mr Tusk has said this is ""now maybe the most critical moment in the history of the eurozone"".
""This is really and truly the final wake-up call for Greece and for us, our last chance,"" he said, adding that failure ""may lead to the bankruptcy of Greece"".
Mr Tsipras's Syriza party was elected in January pledging to oppose the harsh austerity measures demanded by creditors.
And on Sunday, the Greek people decisively rejected the latest bailout proposals from creditors in a referendum.
Energy minister and influential Syriza member Panayiotis Lafazanis insisted on Thursday that Greece would not sign up to a third bailout if it brought ""harsh austerity, suffering and deprivation to the Greek people"".
He insisted Greece had ""alternative options to a new bailout deal"" and there was ""no gun pointed at its head"".
Supporters of Greece staying in the euro held a rally in central Athens on Thursday night.","Greece's government has agreed a reform programme and will submit its proposals to its international lenders soon, the defence minister has said."

Chris Horn, from Newbury in Berkshire, came up with the idea whilst on his tractor and hopes the idea could spread across the UK.
He says the business model could help other young farmers but adds that 40% of their revenue goes on licensing fees.",A fourth generation farmer has found a novel way to diversify his business by showing movies in his fields.
"The film told the story of a fictional plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un. Hackers broke into film company Sony's computers, and weeks later threatened to target any cinema which screened the film.
An FBI investigation concluded that North Korea was to blame for the cyber attack. North Korea responded angrily, with Kim Jong-un calling President Obama a ""monkey"".
What do we know about his ambitions? Four insiders offer their insight into what Kim Jong-un wants.
Jean Lee was born in America to South Korean parents and grew up hearing stories about Korean families separated by the war in 1953. A few years ago, she became the first foreign journalist to open a bureau inside North Korea.
She was in the crowd when Kim Jong-un was first introduced to the Korean people at a military parade, and says he has had to work hard to establish his own power base.
""When he came out there was just a complete sense of shock and awe among the people at the plaza. They had never seen a picture of him. They had only really known of his existence, officially, a few weeks earlier.
""It was quite a shock to see somebody so young who was being groomed to be the next leader. He was not the oldest son, so wasn't the obvious shoo-in. There's clearly something about him, ambition, perhaps a kind of ruthlessness, some qualities that his father saw in him that he thought would carry this country into the next generation.""
The world saw that ruthlessness a year ago, when he ordered the execution of his uncle for allegedly trying to overthrow the state. And the regime is known to use violence to quash dissent among ordinary people too.
But Jean Lee says it would be a mistake to think Kim Jong-un maintains control only through fear:
""One of the things that I've seen on the ground over the past couple of years is all the construction of these skating rinks. There's actually a skateboard park, the ski resort of course that opened last year, massive projects. I see all of this as an investment that they're making in their future.  He is a young man.  If he is going to win the support of the future generations of North Koreans who are going to be his power base, he's got to find a way to win their loyalty and this is part of that.""
Geoffrey See is a Singaporean who has been travelling back and forth to North Korea for the past seven years, working with young entrepreneurs. He says North Koreans are now thinking more innovatively about the economy:
""About six years ago when we first started our programme, our counterparts would often start off with a very long spiel about socialism and how this is the system they have and they are never going to change it.
""In recent years instead of saying that, people talk about... trying to bring in what's best from overseas, and try to adjust it to fit into the system.  So I think that's a very interesting change in terms of thinking.""
Where this new investment is being targeted is also interesting.
""If you look at the economic zones that North Korea was investing in, one of the key areas is Wonsan. So this is an economic zone on the east coast of North Korea.  It faces Japan and it borders South Korea.  So it is kind of almost the furthest location you can have from China. So we believe that it's part of this broader aim to balance off Chinese economic influence in North Korea.""
Kim Jong-un has also been making overtures to Russian President Putin. Two years ago, Russia wrote off 90% of North Korea's debt. But Geoffrey See says there aren't many foreign investors willing to engage with the country's idiosyncratic business environment:
""We would email the North Koreans two, three, four times and we [wouldn't] get a response, and we used to get very worried about it.  We wondered if they are reading our messages, if things are moving ahead.
""We would go in like three months later from the first set of emails.  When we meet with them we ask them, 'Did you receive our emails?' The response is always like, 'Oh, you are coming in three months' time, we didn't feel the need to send a response because we can just chat when you're back in here'.""
Kim Myong Chol was born and lives in Japan, but is ethnically Korean.
He has been to North Korea more than 20 times in the last 40 years, and says he has met representatives of the country's elite as well as, in his words, the two Kims - Kim Jong-un's father and grandfather. He hasn't met the third Kim yet, but praises his ""guts, determination and intelligence"".
The Inquiry: What does Kim Jung-un Want? was broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesday 27 January 2015.

Some describe Kim Myong Chol as an unofficial spokesman for the leader.
""What makes him different from the two Kims,"" he argues, ""is that he will succeed in getting what he wants. The reunification of Korea, without foreign interference.  Eventually the US will leave Korea and the Korean peninsula will be re-unified.
""[The US will] realise the futility, the senselessness of American military presence in Korea. North Korea [will] become too strong for America. We have now nuclear weapons, we have intercontinental ballistic missiles, we have hydrogen bomb.
""We are victims of American aggression. North Korea is a most sanctioned country. Brutalised, criminalised, isolated by America.""
He insists Kim Jong-un's unpredictable behaviour is part of his strategy to fight back:
""North Korea is a very small country. The USA is a big country with nuclear weapons.  How to defeat the enemy? Outsmart them. That's the only way North Korea can survive, outsmart America.""
Yanmei Xie is senior China analyst for the International Crisis Group in Beijing.
She argues that Kim Jong-un can do little without China's support.
""North Korea relies on China for survival. If China cut the fuel supply across the Yarlu River which is between North Korea and China, then the regime... will collapse in a matter of weeks. So Beijing plays a very crucial and vital role in the Korean Peninsula.""
And when North Korea does something that China doesn't like, its punishment is swift and exact:
""When there were reports and intelligence saying North Korea could be on the brink of a fourth nuclear test, China slowed down fuel supply and food aid.
""But before it did that, China looked into the fuel supply and harvest of grain and calculated the amount of reduction in order to make sure that the reduction would not cause instability. [This] was meant to send a signal of displeasure but not to destabilise the regime or cause real pain.""
This is because China also needs its neighbour: North Korea stands between China and the 28,000 US soldiers stationed in South Korea.
""North Korea used to be a military buffer for China in terms of heading off any potential advance of US armies. Now in the age of naval and air dominance of United States, a land war is not as important, but North Korea remains a political buffer in that it is a buffer between China and South Korea, which remains a US ally.
""So China shares interest of managing Kim Jong-un. But I think sometimes people confuse that with signs that China is ready to abandon the Kim Jong-un regime. But actually it's the opposite. China is... stabilising the regime... to prolong, to preserve the current status quo.""

"He died on Monday, aged 89, in a nursing home in Newmarket-on-Fergus in County Clare, following an illness.
Bishop Casey resigned as Bishop of Galway following the revelation he had been making payments to a woman in the United States for a long period.
He had a relationship with an American divorcee and was the father of her son.
Peter Murphy was born in 1974 and was the result of Bishop Casey's affair with Annie Murphy.
Speaking on BBC's Evening Extra programme, Michael Kelly of The Irish Catholic newspaper described the event as ""the beginning of the end of the extreme dominance of the Catholic Church in Irish public life"".
When the relationship became public in 1992, Bishop Casey resigned his post and went to America.
He later moved to Mexico to learn Spanish, worked as a missionary priest in Ecuador and then worked in a parish in England before retiring to Galway 14 years later.
In 2006 he came home to live in Shanaglish, near Gort, County Galway, and then Carrigoran Nursing Home in County Clare in 2011.
Born in County Kerry on 24 April 1927, Bishop Casey was educated in Limerick and in Saint Patrick's College, Maynooth, from where he was ordained to the priesthood in 1951.
For the next nine years he worked as a curate in two Limerick city parishes before being appointed to the Irish Emigrant Chaplaincy Service in England.
He became well-known while working in London for sourcing adequate housing for thousands of Irish emigrants.
On Monday, the Catholic Church said ""his passionate advocacy for social justice and for those marginalised by inequality gave him a significant public profile and his work in this area continued throughout his life"".
He was appointed Bishop of Kerry in 1969 before taking on the larger and more high-profile diocese of Galway and Kilmacduagh in 1976.
""Perhaps the highlight of his time in Galway was his organising and hosting the visit of Pope John Paul II to the city in 1979 to meet and pray with 300,000 young people from all over Ireland,"" the Catholic Church said.
Bishop Casey was present at the funeral of his murdered friend Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador when the liturgy was interrupted by bombs and intense gunfire which left almost 50 mourners dead.
He also voiced strong objections to the visit of US President Ronald Regan to Galway in 1984 because of ""American foreign policy"".
Archbishop Eamon Martin said:  ""It is with great sadness that I learned today of the death of Bishop Eamonn Casey.
""I wish to sincerely acknowledge the contribution of Bishop Casey to the work of the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference over twenty-three years during his time as Bishop of Kerry and as Bishop of Galway"".","Former Bishop of Galway, Eamon Casey, who was at the centre of a scandal that rocked the Catholic Church in the early 1990s, has died."
"Shipping containers are a common feature of the Kenyan landscape.
You'll find these steel boxes converted into comfortable homes, clinics and offices.
Others are turned into shops and granaries to store farm products.
But now shipping containers have entered the sphere of learning.
Starting this year, national examinations materials will be stored in secure shipping containers and placed under 24-hour armed police surveillance.
This is just one of the many new tough measures that the government is introducing to curb cheating in national exams.
In a country where people often rely on well-connected relatives and friends to succeed, education is everything.
Such is the thirst for personal development that around 20:00 on weekday evenings, you'll find the streets of Nairobi and other urban centres teeming with people of all ages going home from class.
Evening classes are a popular way for Kenyans to acquire a second or third degree with the hope of rising higher in life.
Competition for promotion or for the few job opportunities that become available is intense, leading to a desperate desire for more and better academic qualifications.
Joseph Warungu:
""There is a crisis of trust in Kenyan society.""
This pressure to succeed starts at primary school.
As a result, cartels have emerged to take advantage.
Working with some of the former national examinations council officials, police officers and teachers, these cartels have found a way to get hold of exam papers and sell them to desperate students and parents.
But last year things got out of hand as the cheating reached industrial proportions.
More than 5,000 primary and secondary school students had their exam results cancelled; the national examinations board was disbanded and some senior managers fired.
Nearly 200 people including police officers were arrested and charged over exam malpractices.
There is a crisis of trust in Kenyan society.
The government cannot trust the teacher to prepare the students for exams without cheating.
The teacher cannot trust the government to oversee the exams without cheating.
The student cannot trust himself to pass the exam without cheating.
And so in comes the tough steel containers to try and safeguard trust.
This year the government is not taking any chances.
By the time national exams begin in November, invigilators will have been vetted afresh.
Head teachers will now be held personally liable for any incidents of cheating that occur in their schools because they will have the sole responsibility of collecting from, and returning, the exam materials to the containers at central distribution points.
The government is so confident of the measures it has taken that the cabinet secretary for education gave this warning:
""I want to tell all children in candidate classes, that they better prepare for the exams. The monkey business that has been going on shall never happen again"".
But education is not the only sector suffering from the trust deficit.
Governance is badly hit.
Recently, a group of more than 30 elected County Assembly members, who were planning to impeach their Nyeri county governor in central Kenya, decided to spend the night inside the County Assembly under police guard, fearing that their opponents would kidnap them to frustrate the motion.
And in the last few days news has emerged of an invention to help curb drink driving.
The device, developed by a young university student, has an inbuilt breathalyser that detects the driver's alcohol level.
If it's too high, the device transmits a signal and prevents the engine from starting.
So why the need for such a device?
Road accidents kill an average of 3,000 people a year in Kenya and many of the accidents are caused by speeding and drink driving.
The government doesn't trust drivers not to get behind the wheel while drunk, and so it introduced alcohol breathalysers operated by traffic police.
But the public does not trust the police, because they can be easily bribed.
And the drunk driver does not trust anyone else to drive him home safely, except himself.
And so enter the Alcohol and Sound Detection System being developed by a young Kenyan.
It would be far cheaper and more effective to transform the Kenyan mind from within.
Instead the focus is on the symptoms of the epidemic:
If they cheat in exams, lock up exam materials in steel containers.
If democracy is in danger, hide it in locked chambers.
If the driver is too drunk to drive, let the car talk to him.
I think I'll now just retire to my shipping container house and trust that society will sort itself out.

We have spoken to a number of local historians and cinema enthusiasts and the general consensus is that it closed due to dwindling audiences.
Historian Ron Miles said there were once 26 cinemas in the Telford area and two in Oakengates - but they became less popular when people started to get televisions in their own homes.
Another local historian, Rob Breeze, remembers being taken to The Grosvenor to watch Carry on Cleo.
He agreed that a lot of cinemas started closing from the late-1960s onwards, as demand fell.
There is also a theory that the cinema had to close to make way for the flyover carrying the A442 Queensway.
But according to the book ""Silver Screen Memories"" that is not true, because the road was not built until 1975.
Like many parts of the UK, terraced houses - with one design repeated along a row of joined homes - were built in the city in great numbers following the industrial revolution.
Local historian Fred Hughes said many were built around the six town centres of Burslem, Fenton, Hanley, Longton, Stoke and Tunstall.  These went on to form Stoke-on-Trent.
They were built close to industrial centres for pottery and mining due to the lack of transport links, he said, with many knocked down towards the end of the 1950s and early 60s when they were replaced by housing estates like Chell Heath and Bentilee.
Stoke's terraced houses hit the headlines in 2013 when the city council sold off 35 of the properties, mainly in the Cobridge area, for £1.

She pays £825 a month to rent a room in a shared house in Lambeth, south London, where she has her own bathroom and kitchen.
She said: ""I would like to get on the housing ladder but I have resigned myself to the fact that working in social care isn't going to get you the right salary, let alone give you the chance to save up for anything.
""I would love to own a home so that no one can kick me out, as I now have to leave my house as the landlady wants to sell.
""I've lived in Manchester, Edinburgh and my home town in Yorkshire but I've never been happier and more comfortable than in London. This is really important to me and I have created a great network of friends so the idea of moving and starting again somewhere else, as I've done twice before, is too exhausting to think about.
""I hope it doesn't come to having to leave but I suppose I can't rule it out completely if it gets that desperate.""
Freelance musician and composer Matt Winkworth has been renting houses around Oxford for 10 years, but to gain security he has decided to buy a narrow boat, which he intends to live in.
The 31-year-old said: ""Buying a boat is something that I've been thinking about doing for a long time.
""I've thought about getting a mortgage, but I would have to move out of the area that I work [in], it's impossible to buy anywhere in the South East.
""[Living in the boat] will be the first time I have lived on my own.""
Sophie Mogridge moved to Oxford last year and lives in a three-bedroom house with two friends.
The trainee teacher has resigned herself to the fact that she can no longer live in the city, which is considered the most unaffordable place to live in Britain.
She spends £515 a month on rent but, when bills are taken into account, she spends half her £18,000-a-year income on accommodation.
The 23-year-old said: ""My rent is incredibly high but my salary isn't as high.
""That means I'm not able to do all the social things that all my friends [outside of Oxford] can do.
""I'm actually moving to Banbury so I can afford to enjoy life.""

Copeland in Cumbria seems to have that magic mix of cheap rents and high wages.
However, the data does not tell the full story.  Copeland is home to the Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing and nuclear decommissioning site. There are also proposals for a new nuclear power station, the Moorside project, to the north of the current Sellafield site. The energy industry in Copeland also includes the Walney Wind Farm offshore.
Lynne Atkinson, of Cumbrian lettings agency Grisdales, said: ""Nuclear power does skew the figures when it comes to wages as there are some very well-paid jobs in the area.
""It is good value for money renting in Copeland and the market is very strong. It is cheaper than other areas in the North West, such as the Lakes. There has also been a lot of buy to let investment.""
Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""Our chronic housing shortage means private renting is no longer a stepping stone for people starting out in life - it's where a quarter of families have to live.
""And with sky high rents eating up a huge chunk of people's monthly income, it's sadly no surprise that at Shelter we're hearing from growing numbers of families who are struggling just to cover the cost of the basics, and keep a roof over their heads.""

Henry Gregg, assistant director of communications and campaigns at the National Housing Federation said: ""These figures provide yet more evidence of how seriously unaffordable renting is in this country. Sky-high rents mean unstable and uncertain living situations are becoming the norm.""
Our investigation used the median average, which describes the middle value in a set.
The median monthly take home pay in England is about £1,833, after tax and national insurance contributions.
That means rent should take up no more than £550.  The England average price of a room in a house is £382, while a one-bedroom property costs £694.
Alan Ward, who chairs the Residential Landlords Association said there was a rental ""supply crisis"" because the government had focussed on home ownership.
According to a survey carried out by the association, 84% of landlords were considering raising rent due to ""punitive tax changes by the government"".
A Department of Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""More than 300,000 people have been helped in homeownership through government-backed schemes since 2010, while almost 900,000 more homes have been delivered since the end of 2009.
""But we know there is more to do. That's why we've doubled the housing budget, including investing £8bn in an extra 400,000 quality affordable homes to rent and buy.
""We're also extending shared ownership, giving more people the chance to buy a home with a deposit of as little as £1,500.""

"Holyrood's public audit committee has written to the justice secretary saying SPA chairman Andrew Flanagan appeared to have ""behaved inappropriately"".
The letter follows a series of heated evidence sessions at parliament, which saw one MSP tell police bosses ""it's not the Kremlin you're running"".
Mr Flanagan insisted the group has made ""substantial progress"" over 12 months.
MSPs have been conducting an inquiry alongside a separate probe by HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary in Scotland Derek Penman into the governance of the SPA and concerns about transparency.
The letter from the committee, which was addressed to Justice Secretary Michael Matheson and copied to Mr Flanagan, is highly critical of the chairman and the running of the board.
It reads: ""We are writing to set out our very serious concerns about the standards of governance at the SPA, following our recent evidence sessions.
""In particular, we consider that the chairman of the SPA board, Mr Andrew Flanagan, would appear to have behaved inappropriately on occasion and in a manner not in keeping with relevant Scottish government guidance.
""We consider this to be unacceptable, particularly in relation to a public body that performs such a vital role.""
The committee were particularly critical about a row over meetings being held behind closed doors, which saw one board member, Moi Ali, quit. She told members that she felt she had been bullied, describing her exit from the board as ""a really horrendous experience"".
The letter notes: ""It appears to us that Mr Flanagan treated Ms Ali in an inappropriate manner, to the degree that she felt obliged to resign from the board.""
While members acknowledged there would be times when public bodies would have to discuss matters in private, they said the ""default position for such an important body is that its committees should meet in public"".
And they said it would be ""entirely unacceptable"" for the SPA to repeat the situation where private meetings were held to discuss governance with no notes being taken, saying there was ""a clear need for a culture shift within the organisation so that there are far fewer private meetings"".
On the matter of transparency, they said some of the board's ""decisions on basic operational matters have been inexplicable"", and said SPA board members ""should be far more critical in how they question or challenge some of the decisions made by the chair of the board"".
In response to the letter, a spokesman for the SPA said: ""As board members outlined this week, the SPA is listening to public and civic concerns and has already signalled it is ready to adapt its approach at the next public board meeting.
""In addition, HMICS is currently looking at governance within the SPA and we are working closely with the inspectorate to facilitate that review. Its findings and recommendations will further inform our approach to improved governance and transparency.""
During his appearance at Holyrood in April, Mr Flanagan insisted the group had made ""substantial"" progress over the past year, adding: ""I believe I am doing an effective job.""
He said: ""I think we've made a number of substantial movements within the last 12 months based on the governance review.
""I think we are becoming more effective, I think it is important that we recognise that there is already a high and significant degree of openness through the public board meetings that we have which are second to none in terms of public bodies in Scotland.
""I think we are on a journey. Is it perfect? No, it's not perfect, but I think in the last 12 months or so there have been significant steps forward.""
And in a subsequent sitting on Thursday, current board member George Graham said there had been a ""changing atmosphere"" since Mr Flanagan took over, saying the board was ""much more engaged"" with ""a clearer sense of purpose"".","MSPs have voiced ""very serious concerns"" about how the Scottish Police Authority is run."

"The researchers say that soda is more effective than current methods and less damaging to the environment.
The team have already successfully trialled microcapsules filled with the substance.
They believe that the baking soda approach could be 40% cheaper than existing technology.
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is believed by many scientists and politicians to be a critical element in global attempts to avoid dangerous levels of climate change caused by CO2 emissions.
The burning of coal, gas and oil for energy production remains the single biggest source of the gas.
For years researchers have been working to build experimental technology that would capture CO2 from chimneys and flue pipes before it gets into the atmosphere. The gas would then be buried permanently, deep underground.
Indeed the promises made in Paris Climate Agreement to limit global temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degrees will need significant deployment of CCS.
""Nobody can see us keeping temperatures increases below 1.5 degrees without these technologies,"" said Dr Oliver Geden at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.
""Yet there hasn't been any debate about this technology and it doesn't exist at scale.""
The equipment and chemicals that need to be built on to a power station to extract the CO2 are known to be expensive and cumbersome.
While governments and industry both recognise the benefits of such a system, they have been unwilling to put up the large amounts of cash needed.
Late last year the UK government pulled the plug on a Â£1bn competition to build a scaled-up version of the technology.
Scientists are now looking at other materials to see if they can achieve the same impact but at a lower cost.
At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California, they believe that baking soda could be a key ingredient for curbing the carbon.
They've created microcapsules that have a liquid solution of sodium carbonate (also known as soda ash) at their core, surrounded by a polymer shell that allows CO2 to flow through.
The tiny blue balls sit in an aqueous solution which prevents them from sticking together. When they come in contact with CO2 they change colour to a yellowish brown. Exposure of sodium carbonate to CO2 and water creates sodium bicarbonate - otherwise known as baking soda.
""The whole idea is that by making these individual capsules you can have a dramatically increased surface area, so if they clump together you can decrease that,"" said researcher Congwang Ye.
""You really want to have them separated.""
The scientists say that current CCS techniques using chemicals like monoethanolamine are toxic and expensive and create as many problems as they solve.
The LLNL team believe that baking soda can do an effective job at a much lower price.
""Like all the commercial CO2 schemes we have today, the goal for large scale implementation is taking many tonnes of gas from a power plant and finding geological features deep underground where we can inject that CO2 and it will stay indefinitely,"" said Joshua Stolaroff, an environmental researcher at Livermore.
""Microcapsule solvents like we've developed can do that, we hope, at lower energy use and capital cost, about 40% lower than the current methods.""
One advantage of the microcapsule approach is that recovery of the captured carbon is done by heating the baking soda solution, and that means the scientists get a more pure form of the gas - which increases its value for other industries.
But with production of the capsules limited to about a kilogram a day, the research team understand that this is a long term project.
""We think in the US, our regulations will promote carbon capture and storage at a commercial scale around 2022, and we look at technologies that can be ready around that time,"" said Joshua Stolaroff.
""We hope that around that time frame the benefits of our technologies will be developed and known.""
Thanks to 3D printing and advanced computational techniques, the researchers in California are not limited to capsules.
They are developing a range of materials that can be built and tested quickly thanks to the technology.
""You can think of it as CO2 capture fabric,"" said engineer Du Nguyen as he showed me a little pink piece of material.
""What this is made of is a silicone material and inside of that are lots of little bits of sodium carbonate. You can almost think of it as a CO2 sponge.""
The idea is that the researchers can customise carbon capture materials to fit chimneys or flue pipes. The absorbent sponge could be printed to fill a structure completely which would more effectively soak up carbon, thus reducing costs.
The researchers test the effectiveness of the baking soda materials by soaking them in sparkling water. The baking soda absorbs the carbon bubbles, rapidly turning the water flat.
The scientists believe that the baking soda capsules and sponges could be used in a host of applications, not just at power plants.
They argue that since the materials are easy to transport and recover the carbon gas from, they could kick start the growth of niche carbon recovery operations in places like breweries.
Several years of testing and refining the products lie ahead - but the researchers believe that what they are learning could have a significant long term impact on carbon emissions.
""Sometimes the solutions have been sitting right in front of you for a very long time,"" said Joshua Stolaroff with a laugh.
""And we think there is great promise that baking soda might save the world!""

"Goodluck Jonathan said it had been not just an attack on Nigeria, but an attack on the international community.
The radical Islamist group, Boko Haram, told the BBC it was behind the blast in the capital, which left at least 23 people dead and 81 wounded.
Mr Jonathan said the group was a ""local problem"" that had to be dealt with.
Boko Haram, which is fighting for the establishment of Sharia law in Nigeria, is alleged to have had contacts with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which operates in North Africa, and al-Shabab in Somalia.
The BBC's Mark Doyle in Abuja says Friday's suicide attack shows Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates as ""Western education is forbidden"", is getting bolder and that Nigeria has a growing security crisis.
For two years, the Islamist group has been targeting government and mounting a campaign of killings, but attacking the United Nations in the heart of the capital is a major escalation, our correspondent adds.
The bomber drove his vehicle through the headquarters' two security barriers, then crashed into the reception area before detonating the explosives.
The blast was powerful enough to bring down parts of the structure, where about 400 UN personnel work, and blow out the windows of nearby buildings.
Standing among the broken glass and twisted metal on Saturday, President Jonathan told reporters: ""I and all Nigerians are shocked.""
""Terrorist attacks on any individual or part of the world is a terrorist attack on the rest of the world,"" he added. ""Terrorists don't care about who is anywhere.""
""We will work with the UN and other world leaders to ensure that terrorism is brought under control.""
When asked by the BBC what he would do about Boko Haram, he gave no direct answer but acknowledged it posed a threat.
""Boko Haram is a local group linked up with terrorist activities and as a government, we are working on it and we will bring it under control.""
Our correspondent says Nigeria's government has tried negotiating with Boko Haram and cracking down hard, but neither tactic has worked.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on Friday that he condemned ""this terrible act utterly"", and sent Deputy Secretary General Asha-Rose Migiro and Under-Secretary General for Security Greg Starr to Nigeria.
On Saturday, the UN's top official in Nigeria said nine of its staff were confirmed dead and that dozens were being treated in hospital.
""We have lost motivated, bright, selfless people who were working only for the good of Nigeria and the world,"" said Agathe Lawson, the UN's acting resident co-ordinator.
""Our priority now is to ensure those who are injured and the families of those who died are cared for.""
Mr Lawson said that her ""second and urgent priority"" was to ensure that UN operations continued in Africa's most populous nation.
""We will not be deterred in our mission to work to improve the lives of Nigerians. This is why we are here,"" she added.
Shortly after President Jonathan left the bomb site, agents from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrived to help investigate.
""The FBI is on the ground at the request of the Nigerian government,"" said US embassy spokeswoman Deborah MacLean without elaborating.","Nigeria's president has promised to bring terrorism under control, during a visit to the scene of Friday's bombing at the UN's headquarters in Abuja."

If the former Nottingham Forest and Derby County defender had access to the sort of help and support he is now eager to offer young footballers, he may well have achieved a great deal more.
Now retraining as a counsellor, Charles - still best remembered for his innocent part in the infamous tackle that almost ended Paul Gascoigne's career - is determined to give something back to the sport that gave him so much.
His journey has been far from smooth, with the low point a six-month prison sentence for dangerous driving and failing to give a breath sample that was brought about by his drinking.
Following his time in the East Midlands Charles, who won two England caps, was forced to retire at the age of 32 after injury-plagued spells with Aston Villa, Benfica and West Ham. It was the injuries that led to the boozing.
""While I was playing I was disciplined,"" Charles told BBC Inside Out. ""As soon as I was injured - if it was for any length of time - I would maybe go out a little bit more than I would normally. But it wouldn't be all the time.
""I am the first to admit that I have had my issues with drinking and I am a recovering alcoholic. But my drinking was very different from someone drinking every day. It wasn't all the time, it would be the odd time that would last two or three days.
""I wasn't a typical alcoholic. I could stop and go long periods of time without drinking.
""But toward the end of my football career it would last a little bit longer - definitely. As soon as I was nearly back to full fitness, I would go back in to my disciplined life again.""

Charles has been sober for nine years. The 45-year-old is director of football at Nottingham University and is working with Priority Health - a specialist organisation to help young footballers.
And he really wants to help.
""If a lot more people were more honest and there wasn't such a stigma around alcoholics or drug addicts then a lot of people would benefit from it,"" Charles said.
""We need to encourage young players not to live with addictions and talk to people.
""I know it is hard for a young player to go to a coach or an assistant manager and say 'listen I am struggling with drinking' or gambling or whatever because they do think it could be detrimental to their careers and maybe they will not get the contract of their dreams.
""There are things away from football clubs and there are people you can speak to.
""I want people to know that if you are struggling with addiction, speak to somebody about it because it does help. You don't have to go through hell when you can address your issues a lot earlier and go on and live a normal life.""
His time in prison was the real end of his ""normal life"" and helped set him on the way to sobriety. Charles was struggling to deal with the end of his career and it was at this point that he realised things needed to change.
""Prison was definitely something that opened my eyes to being somewhere I didn't want to continue going,"" Charles said.
""I just didn't want to drink any more or feel the way I was feeling any more. I had just had enough.
""Football is very much a closed shop but I think it is something that needs to be talked about. Addiction does not pick a certain type.""
Football life for London-born Charles began brilliantly as a youngster forcing his way in to Brian Clough's Forest side at the end of the 1980s.
""It's a big thing when you actually come in to a club and you are here every day and are watching the first team play,"" Charles said.
""The Forest team had a lot of great players at the time. I still remember cleaning the boots of Johnny Metgod, Garry Birtles, Gary Mills and Gary Fleming; they were the four players I looked after.
""That was one of the biggest things I enjoyed because I got to go in to the first team dressing room and listen to what they spoke about.""
Despite all Charles achieved, it was his part in the Gazza story that still triggers the memory banks when his name crops up.
Forest reached the 1991 FA Cup final where they played a Tottenham side featuring Gascoigne and Gary Lineker.
Despite going ahead through a trademark Stuart Pearce free-kick, Brian Clough's Forest lost a thrilling match 2-1.
But the game - enthralling as it was - was overshadowed by two moments of Gazza madness. His first challenge on Garry Parker saw Gascoigne plant his foot in the Forest midfielder's chest, the second saw the Lazio-bound superstar rupture a cruciate ligament in his right knee because of his ugly lunge on Charles.
""I remember the tackle on Parks,"" Charles said. ""I thought that was worse than my one to be honest. It was just a mis-timed tackle. It is something that every professional footballer has done.
""I didn't think much of it. I know a lot was made of it but I was more disappointed with us losing the game. If you speak to a lot of the Forest lads that is one of our biggest regrets. It was a massive day for the club.""
Charles wants to ensure the young footballers he comes into contact with will only have reason to regret matters on the pitch.

"Separation talks could be completed within the two year deadline set out in Article 50, but a future relationship would take longer to negotiate, Sir Simon Fraser told BBC Newsnight.
Sir Simon said ""transitional arrangements"" would be necessary.
Prime Minister Theresa May will invoke Article 50 on Wednesday.
""It's certain that we won't have resolved everything in the period before the expiry of the Article 50 process,"" Sir Simon Fraser told BBC Newsnight.
""The EU side want to start with negotiating the terms of the separation... And the British side, on top of that, wants to move rapidly to discuss the future relationship - both political and economic - between Britain and the EU. And that is a very complex second set of negotiations.""
Because of the difficulty of defining the future relationship, Sir Simon, who held senior posts in Brussels and Whitehall before becoming the head of the diplomatic service, believes talks will soon shift to the nature of 'transitional arrangements'. This means vital questions about how the UK does business with the EU could be left unresolved far beyond 2019.
Many Brexit supporters had hoped informal negotiations with the EU could start before the Article 50 clock begins ticking this week. Negotiations are limited to two years.
But Sir Simon said the European Commission has thwarted such plans: ""There has been a very disciplined position across the EU, and I don't think that there has been a lot of informal behind the scenes discussion of the agenda or of the key issues yet.""
Sir Simon is also sceptical that the UK will be able to play off different countries among the EU's 27 countries.
""The UK has got to negotiate with the EU as a whole through the EU's appointed negotiator, which will be essentially led by the Commission.""
He added: ""I think it would be a mistake to try divide and rule because I don't think that that will work.""
While Article 50 allows up to two years to reach an agreement, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he wants the outline of a deal to be ready by autumn 2018, in the hope that it can then go before the European Parliament for ratification and member states for agreement well before the deadline is up.
But many diplomats, Sir Simon Fraser among them, believe that there will be no serious political discussions before this autumn, following the German elections.
While Brexit dominates national debate in the UK, it is a secondary issue for many European governments.
This could lead to delays in negotiations with many governments not taking positions until they have to. Combined with the complexity of the Brexit discussions, many diplomats believe that the UK could find itself close to a ""cliff edge"" without final agreement.
Sir Simon said while it was in the interest of both sides to avoid such a scenario, there was a ""risk of political ill will and turbulence - both political and economic"" if a deal is not reached within the Article 50 timeframe.
It is for this reason that Mr Barnier may want to make transitional arrangements dependent on a resolution of one of the first items on the EU's divorce agenda: getting the UK to agree to paying a bill of tens of billions into the Commission's coffers.

"Anne sent the eight-line verse to a friend in 1942.
The auction house in the Netherlands had valued the rare, handwritten note at €30,000-€50,000.
Anne is best remembered for her diaries of life as a German-born Jew in occupied Amsterdam in World War Two.
The poem was signed and dated 28 March 1942, which was less than four months before the Frank family moved into a secret apartment to hide from German forces.
Addressed ""Dear Cri-Cri"", it was given to Christiane van Maarsen, the older sister of one of Anne's best friends, Jacqueline.
The Bubb Kuyper auction house, based in the Dutch city of Haarlem, said Jacqueline van Maarsen was selling the poem because she knew her sister, who died in 2006, did not see it as a prized possession.
In a note published on the auctioneers' website, she wrote, ""My sister (nicknamed Cri-Cri) tore this page out of her poezie album and gave it to me around 1970. I know that my sister was not as attached to this verse from Anne to her as I am to the verse Anne addressed to me.""
It was common for girls of the era to collate notes from friends in scrapbooks they called poezie albums.
The first four lines of the poem, which encouraged the older sister to work hard at school, are known to have been copied from a magazine.
The second four carried on the same edifying theme, but may be Anne's original work.
The auctioneers noted that Anne switched her style of handwriting midway through writing.
Her diaries have become one the most important documents to emerge from the Holocaust. Her father published them after she died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen Nazi death camp aged 15.","A poem by Dutch schoolgirl Anne Frank written shortly before her family went into hiding from the Nazis has sold at auction for €140,000 ($148,000; £120,000), well over the estimate."
"The regulator said the bid did not comply with the laws of having its principal place of business in the Chinese territory.
The city's other carriers had also objected, it said.
Qantas said it would reconsider basing the low-cost carrier in Hong Kong.
The carrier is a three-way joint venture between Qantas Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Hong Kong investment firm Shun Tak Holdings.
""Jetstar Hong Kong cannot make its decisions independently from that of the two foreign shareholders,"" said the Air Transport Licensing Authority when handing down its decision.
It also said the city's other carriers, including Cathay Pacific and Dragon Airlines, had objected to Jetstar's application.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the decision was disappointing for shareholders as well as ""for the travellers that Jetstar Hong Kong planned to serve"".
""It's the travelling public who have lost out, because the message from this decision is that Hong Kong appears closed to fresh aviation investment even when it is majority locally-owned and controlled,"" he said in a statement on Friday.
He added that Hong Kong was going in the opposite direction of other aviation markets in Asia that were ""opening up"".
""Given the importance of aviation to global commerce, shutting the door to new competition can only serve the vested interests already installed in that market.""
The airline, along with its partners, said it had not yet decided on whether to appeal the decision.
The joint venture was valued at $10m Australian dollars ($7.7m; Â£4.9m), according to Qantas.
Shares of Qantas were down 1.4% in Sydney in reaction to the news.","Hong Kong authorities have rejected an application by Qantas-backed Australian budget carrier Jetstar to set up a local airline, after nearly two years of deliberation."
"In a letter to media buyers, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) has threatened to strike from 2 May.
It's to do with a row over pay - writers say they have been losing revenue in recent years, 23% in the last two years alone.
Also, because so many series are getting shorter but writers contracts remain the same length, many of them find themselves locked into a contract without other work.
""Should this [strike] occur, writing for television, feature films and digital series will cease,"" the letter says.
This would be catastrophic for the major networks, which were hugely affected when the WGA went on strike for 100 days in 2007.
Many TV networks struggled to fill their schedules, which led to an increase in repeats and reality TV shows.
In light of the letter, five days of negotiations are due to begin on Monday. If they don't go well - loads of your favourite shows could become victims of the strike.
Unlike the last time, many viewers will now be able to turn to streaming services to plug the gap in new content. However for traditional TV networks and film studios, a new strike would cause chaos.
Shows which are unscripted, don't use union writers or have already wrapped filming, wouldn't generally suffer. But here are some examples of shows which would.
The genre that would be impacted most immediately would be the live entertainment and late night chat shows.
Unlike UK talk shows fronted by the likes of Graham Norton and Jonathan Ross air weekly, most US chat shows - which are also broadcast in the UK - air every night.
As you can imagine, that requires a heck of a lot of material, and therefore a heck of a lot of writers.
The likes of Jimmy Kimmel Live, Saturday Night Live and The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon would struggle to stay on air.
During the last strike, talk shows hosted by David Letterman, Jon Stewart and Conan O'Brien all ran repeats instead of airing new programmes.
Many stayed off air until the strike was over, while some returned and filled air time by ad-libbing or airing previously-recorded segments.
O'Brien, Letterman and Jay Leno even started to pay some of their regular writers out of their own pockets to provide new material during the strike.
In 2007, some networks stockpiled episodes to try and minimise the impact of the writers' strike.
A few soap operas like Days of Our Lives and All My Children had their scripts completed to last them through to January, when the strike was due to end.
Dramas such as The Wire and The Shield also completed filming their current seasons and so were unaffected.
But others floundered.
Some shows were cancelled altogether, despite having ended on a cliff hanger (you can imagine how viewers reacted to that).
Others had their seasons cut short (Pushing Daisies), had new episodes delayed (24, Entourage) or their season length shortened (30 Rock, Breaking Bad, The Big Bang Theory).
Many of the shows due to begin this summer would likely be unaffected as they're already in production or completed, such as Veep, Fear The Walking Dead and Orange Is The New Black,
But shows which are due to begin in the crucial fall season, which writers begin working on in May and June, are at severe risk.
As the new letter from the WGA states: ""Any delay in the start of work has the potential to postpone fall season premieres and reduce the amount of new programming available to advertisers and audiences.""
This would affect brand new shows as well as programmes already hugely popular with audiences like Modern Family and Empire.
Of course, a strike wouldn't just impact TV shows - films can suffer as well.
Perhaps the most obvious casualty of the last one was the slightly dodgy James Bond film, Quantum of Solace.
Hot on the heels of the hugely popular and critically acclaimed Casino Royale, expectations for Daniel Craig's second Bond film were high.
But the actor famously ended up writing some sections of his own dialogue because of the lack of writers available to work on the movie.
The franchise redeemed itself with Skyfall and Spectre, but other standalone films didn't have that luxury.
Johnny Depp adventure drama Shantaram was put on hold because of strike related script issues and was never made
Oscar-nominated musical Nine, which starred Nicole Kidman, Daniel Day-Lewis and Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas, was severely delayed.
Production had to be postponed from early 2008 to the second half of the year, pushing back its scheduled release date.
And at the height of awards season, the 2008 Golden Globes were cancelled with the winners read out at a press conference as there was no one to write the host's jokes.
Thankfully a deal was reached in time to allow stars to dress up and go to the Oscars.

"Tony Tyler called for drone regulations to be put in place before any serious accidents occur.
He said the threat posed by unmanned aerial vehicles is still evolving.
""I am as excited as you are about the prospect of having pizza delivered by a drone,"" he told a conference in Singapore.
""But we cannot allow [drones] to be a hindrance or safety threat to commercial aviation,"" said Mr Tyler, director-general of the International Air Transport Association.
""The issue is real. We have plenty of pilot reports of drones where they were not expected, particularly at low altitudes around airports,"" he added. ""There is no denying that there is a real and growing threat to the safety of civilian aircraft [coming from drones].
""We need a sensible approach to regulation and a pragmatic method of enforcement for those who disregard rules and regulations and put others in danger.""
Drones were recently involved in four serious near-misses at UK airports, the UK Air Proximity Board said in January.
The board, which investigates near-miss incidents in UK airspace, said a drone had come very close to colliding with a Boeing 737 that had taken off from Stansted airport.
IATA's primary concern is drones flying at low altitudes near airports that could threaten planes taking off or landing, Rob Eagles of Iata said.
Aviation regulators also want to make sure that the radio spectrum used to control the drones does not interfere with air traffic control systems, he said.
In December the US government set up a registration system for Americans who own drones.
Anyone who has a drone must register with the Federal Aviation Administration before the device takes its first flight.
Owners have until Friday to register their details or face being fined.
The move comes after several reported incidents of drones hindering emergency services' efforts in fighting fires and other dangers.","Drones flown by the general public are ""a real and growing threat"" to civilian aircraft, the head of aviation trade body Iata has warned."
"President Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci met in Nicosia's neutral buffer zone.
UN envoy Espen Barth Eide said they ""shared their vision for a united Cyprus"".
Mr Akinci was elected last month. The Turkish-controlled north broke away in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup.
Since a Turkish military invasion in 1974 the island has been effectively partitioned, with the northern third inhabited by Turkish Cypriots and the southern two-thirds by Greek Cypriots.
Peace negotiations stalled last October, when the Greek Cypriots walked out in protest at the presence of a Turkish ship prospecting for natural gas off the island's south coast.
Correspondents say there are hopes that Mr Akinci, a leftist moderate, can push forward the new round of negotiations.
""The talks took place in a very positive climate and I believe that working in similar fashion, we can hope for progress,"" Associated Press quoted Mr Anastasiades as saying after Friday's UN-brokered meeting.
In an initial move, Turkish Cypriot authorities agreed to no longer require Greek Cypriots to fill in visa forms at crossing points to northern Cyprus, UN envoy Mr Eide told reporters.
Compensation for those displaced by the conflict is expected to be one of the thorniest issues in the talks.
UN peacekeeping forces estimate that 165,000 Greek Cypriots fled or were expelled from the north, and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots from the south, although the parties to the conflict say the figures are higher.
The self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is diplomatically isolated, recognised only by Turkey.","The leaders of the divided Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus have resumed peace talks amid a ""climate of optimism"", the UN mediator says."
"United ended a run of four derby defeats with a convincing 4-2 win at Old Trafford that left City with their sixth loss in their last eight games.
Pellegrini, 61, said: ""It is my responsibility and the only way we can change this is by winning games.
""I am not talking about my position. It is not important.""
City won the Premier League title last season and were level on points with leaders Chelsea in January, nine points above rivals United.
But they are now four points below United in fourth and face being dragged into a fight to secure Champions League football next season as Liverpool could close the gap to just four points with victory against Newcastle United at Anfield on Monday.
Pellegrini added: ""The only way to explain our run is that we don't have the results. We lost many points, not only in this game which was a very difficult one, but in others too.
""We played very well for 20 minutes but we must not play just for 20 minutes, we must play for the whole game in the same way.
""We are concerned but now we must try to win the next game at home to West Ham. We have been first or second the whole year and now we are fourth but United and Arsenal have to play against Chelsea. We have 18 more points to play for. We must not be dramatic.""
City faded after taking the early lead through Sergio Aguero and Pellegrini conceded that United's stirring comeback may have affected his team's fragile spirit.
""Maybe it is something we can be concerned by,"" he said. ""It is easy when you are two goals in front to play with more trust than the team that is two goals behind.
""We made important mistakes for the second goal and the third was offside but the result was a fair one.""",Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini took full responsibility for his side's alarming slump but refused to discuss his long-term future.
"About 15 students, from the 'Fossil Free QUB' group, have been occupying part of the university's administration building since Friday.
A QUB spokesperson said a review of its investment policy is taking place.
The review will be completed next spring.
The spokesperson added that the university is happy to hold discussions with Fossil Free QUB, but there would be no immediate decision taken on its investment policy outside of the review.
The Green Party Northern Ireland, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) Alliance Party, Sinn FÃ©in and People Before Profit have all expressed support for the fossil free campaign.
Belfast city Green Party NI councillor Ross Brown was at the demonstration at Queen's, and called for the university to disinvest in fossil fuels.
""There are investment indexes that exist now that exclude fossil fuels, so there's no stopping Queen's choosing those indexes and taking their money out of fossil fuels.""
The Sinn FÃ©in MLA Chris Hazzard also said the university should take action now, rather than waiting for the results of a review.
""Other universities around the world, including Sheffield, have recently done this, so it's time for Queen's to do that too,"" he said.
Meanwhile, freedom of information requests carried out by the Fossil Free QUB organisation - and seen by the BBC - show that some of Queen's money is subsequently invested in;
However, these types of investments are not unusual, according to a wealth management expert.
Ewan Boyle, director of Johnston Campbell financial advisors, told the BBC that many organisations had diverse portfolios.
""If we look at the top 100 companies in the UK, around 25% of those have a bias towards mining or oil, so avoiding those companies if you are a large investor is virtually impossible"" he said.
""Queen's are passing their money to fund managers, who are responsible for investing that money, and their primary objective is to get the best returns they possibly can.""
""It's what many pension funds, and many large organisations are doing,"" Mr Boyle added.
""Mining and oil have been huge growth areas in recent years, so that's where the fund managers are investing to get those returns.""
A Queen's spokesperson said that university business was continuing as normal, although a small number of staff in the finance office had been relocated.","A number of politicians have attended the protest calling for Queen's University, Belfast (QUB) to sell shares it holds in fossil fuel firms."

"Reporters said they appeared healthy but a little distressed after their long journey.
A circus surrendered some of the lions, while others were taken in raids.
The US-based group Animal Defenders International (ADI), which was behind the action, says almost all the lions have had teeth or claws removed.
They would not survive in the wild.
The lions are being transferred by land to the Emoya Big Cat Sanctuary, a 5,000-hectare reserve in northern South Africa. There, the lions will have drinking pools, platforms, toys and veterinary care.
""This is a hugely important rescue mission because it does make a statement around the world about the way people treat animals,"" ADI spokeswoman Jan Creamer said.
""These lions have suffered tremendously.""
The first group of nine lions was collected in Colombia's capital Bogota on a cargo plane, which then flew to Peru's capital Lima to pick up 24 more animals.
""It will be hugely satisfying to see these lions walking into the African Bush,"" ADI Vice-President Tom Phillips was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency.
The lions were freed after the use of wild animals was banned in Peru in 2011 and Colombia in 2013.
The 5,000-hectare (12,355 acres)  Emoya Big Cat Sanctuary is on private land and already houses six other rescued lions and two tigers.
The lion habitats there would be steadily expanded over the coming months as the lions became familiar with their new life and were introduced to each other, said ADI.",More than 30 lions rescued from circuses in Colombia and Peru have been flown to South Africa to start a new life in a sanctuary.
"The Plymouth towers will have cladding removed after it emerged it was made of similar material to Grenfell Tower.
It was expected to be removed within days, but authorities now say it won't be taken down until at least November.
Plymouth Community Homes says additional safety precautions are in place to ensure its residents' safety.
More on tower block cladding delay and other Devon and Cornwall stories
Chloe Brewster, 22, fled her flat in the Mount Wise Tower estate with her baby after a fire broke out in one of the blocks earlier this year.
""It's absolutely horrifying to think that it's going to be at least to the end of the year that they're going to remove the cladding,"" she said.
""There is a highly likely chance of a fire happening between now and the end of the year.
""At the end of the day they're not the ones that are having nightmares about burning to death with a baby in a tower block.""
Plymouth Community Homes said it would not follow Camden Council's decision to evacuate residents, because the Mount Wise towers have additional fires safety measures and precautions in place.
CEO John Clark said last week that the cladding would be removed ""over the next couple of days"".
But in a letter to residents on Tuesday the housing authority said specialist consultants had identified a target date for the removal of the panels by the end of November.
Labour MP Luke Pollard has also claimed that some people living in high-rise flats are being refused insurance renewals.","A young mother says she has nightmares about ""burning to death"" with her baby after work on three tower blocks was delayed."
"Norway went ahead midway through the first half when the Hegerberg sisters combined to make the breakthrough.
Andrine Hegerberg sent a free-kick into the box for sibling Ada to head past Siobhan Chamberlain from close range.
England are next in action on Tuesday when they face Sweden, the Olympic silver medallists from Rio, in Murcia.
Their best chances against Norway fell to Fara Williams and Lucy Bronze, who saw efforts from the edge of the box go over the crossbar.
Steph Houghton's shot from a corner was cleared off the line, while Ellen White had a penalty appeal turned down after she appeared to receive a shove in the penalty area.
Norway continued to push for a second goal but Chamberlain made a string of impressive saves to deny the opposition.
With the Women's Super League clubs returning from their close season break only two weeks ago, the majority of the England players are still some way from peak fitness.
Even so, with the European Championship seven months away, a defeat by quality opposition such as Norway will be a disappointment to England manager Mark Sampson.
The match was England's first since November and they appeared to lose some of the free-flowing football they were displaying in the back end of 2016.
Having failed to create a single clear-cut chance in the first half, the introduction of Millie Bright and White looked welcome in the 68th minute.
The team came to life in the closing moments, when they won a string of corners which they followed up with on-target efforts but failed to find the equaliser.
Sampson played a 3-4-3 formation and despite the defeat, England looked mostly solid across the park but lacked the creativity to find an equaliser for large part of the game.
Media playback is not supported on this device
After topping their Euro 2017 qualifying group, England came into the match on a 10-game unbeaten run and showed a gritty determination to get back into the match.
Chamberlain, deputising for the injured Karen Bardsley, made a string of impressive saves to prevent England from going further behind.
Jade Moore once again showed her battling qualities and her ability to control play in the middle of the field, while on the left wing Demi Stokes displayed pace and power.
For some players, this training camp could be one of their last chances to impress before the summer and Sampson is expected to make a number of changes ahead of Tuesday's match against Sweden.
Striker Danielle Carter, who did not play against Norway, will miss the Sweden game with a hamstring injury.
The Arsenal striker, 23, will remain with the squad in La Manga. Chelsea defender Hannah Blundell has been called up as a replacement.

"Travis was convicted in September of indecently assaulting a woman and given a three month sentence suspended for two years.
A hearing at Southwark Crown Court heard that he had racked up a taxi fare bill of £4,456 during his trials.
He was awarded travel costs, limited to the value of a day return train ticket and £50 for a taxi, and hotel costs.
Stephen Vullo QC, representing Travis, made the defendant's costs application and said his client had been ""financially devastated"" by trials in February and September last year.
""He has no money left whatsoever,"" he said.
""He is now below zero.""
Mr Vullo also claimed £630 in hotel accommodation, and £246 for travel to legal conferences, and asked for a total of £5,332 towards Travis's costs.
Judge Leonard ruled that Travis could claim the costs of a daily return train ticket from Aylesbury to Marylebone, which the judge said cost £61.40, as well as £50 a day for reasonable taxi costs from the station.
He allowed the hotel costs.
Referring to Travis's back problems, Judge Leonard said: ""His infirmity was such that the benefit from the train, to get up from his seat rather than remain in it, is something that could only have been achieved on a train, not a car.""
The defence estimated that Travis travelled from his home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, to court on 37 days, which means he could be entitled to £4,121.80.
The number of days will be confirmed with the court at a later stage.
Prosecutor Joshua Munro argued the costs were not ""reasonable"" expenses for the taxpayer to fund.
Travis was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault after a trial in February 2014.
The jury was unable to decide on verdicts on an additional count of indecent assault and one count of sexual assault and a retrial was ordered.
The Crown Prosecution Service added one more count of indecent assault, the offence of which he was eventually convicted, on the indictment for the September 2014 trial.
Travis was cleared of the indecent assault on which he was retried, and after a second jury was unable to reach a verdict on the sexual assault charge, Judge Anthony Leonard QC, directed a not guilty verdict.","Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis was ""financially ruined"" by his lengthy legal battles, a court has heard."
"Greater Manchester Police said the corrosive liquid hit a man and a woman in the eyes on Ashton Old Road, Openshaw, Manchester on Friday evening.
Shortly afterwards, bleach was thrown at a second man on the same road by a passenger in a silver Ford Fiesta heading towards Audenshaw.
Police said those affected were ""lucky"" to escape serious injury.
Insp Cherie Dunn, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ""I am so thankful that none of the victims of these senseless attacks has been seriously injured.
""We could easily have been dealing with life-changing injuries.
""Anyone thinking that throwing bleach at people is funny or that a crime like this does not have consequences couldn't be more wrong.
""The victim's here were lucky. Bleach attacks could have had catastrophic consequences.""",A pregnant woman was among three people targeted when bleach was thrown from a car in two separate attacks.
"The visitors led at the break through Helder Costa's penalty after Dave Edwards was felled by Jon McLaughlin.
Burton piled on the pressure after half-time and levelled when former Wolves winger Michael Kightly marked his debut by tapping in from two yards.
Woodrow hooked in the winner deep in injury time after Wolves failed to clear a corner.
Burton's win means they remain three points clear of the Championship relegation zone after third-from-bottom Blackburn also snatched a late victory over QPR, while Wolves drop to 18th after Nottingham Forest's injury-time win over Aston Villa.
In a scrappy first half of few chances, Lasse Vigen Christensen, on loan from Fulham like Woodrow, volleyed over Tom Flanagan's cross, while Wolves striker Nouha Dicko saw a shot tipped around the post by McLaughlin.
The visitors finally took the lead five minutes before the break when Costa drilled his spot-kick high into the net after McLaughlin brought down Edwards.
But Paul Lambert's side struggled to create anything of note after the break as Burton dominated.
Carl Ikeme tipped a Kightly shot around the post and a free-kick over the bar before the winger, who joined on loan from Burnley on deadline day, finally claimed the equaliser by converting Marvin Sordell's pass.
And Nigel Clough's side, who grabbed an injury-time equaliser when the two sides drew 1-1 at Molineux in September, got the winner when Woodrow turned in Flanagan's header from close range in the fourth minute of stoppage time.
Burton manager Nigel Clough: ""It's about time we had one go in our favour. We have had enough heartaches to last us three seasons in the first 20-odd games.
""It's about the first time anything has really broken for us in the last minute in the penalty area. The corner has come in and just dropped to two of our lads and Cauley has ended up putting it in.
""The two new lads get the goals and it makes a difference when you can bring a few bodies in during January.
""We have created a few chances throughout the season, but it's nice now to have people who can finish them off.""
Wolves head coach Paul Lambert told BBC WM: ""In the first half I thought we did a lot with the ball. We got the lead and it gives you something to go with at half-time
""But in the second half we were not the same and we allowed Burton to come back into the game.
""The first goal is poor from our point of view, because it's too easy for them to get through our defence. For the second, our marking was not good enough at the set play.
""We have set ourselves such a high standard so the disappointment is there for everybody today. Sometimes you need a reality check, and today we just weren't good enough.""

"The bodies of the state's first mental institution - called the Insane Asylum - stretch across 20 acres of campus where administrators want to build.
Officials predict that it may cost up to $21m (Â£16m) to exhume and rebury each body - more than $3,000 for each.
The campus medical centre, where the bodies have been discovered, is looking at cheaper alternatives.
The university hopes to bring the total cost down by handling the exhumations in-house, the Clarion-Ledger newspaper reports.
They predict that it can be done for $400,000 per year over the next eight years.
They also hope to create a memorial and laboratory where students can study the patients' remains, as well as remnants of clothes and wood unearthed in the process.
A group of academics have formed a consortium dedicated to studying the remains.
""We have inherited these patients,"" said Ralph Didlake, who oversees the campus Center for Bioethics and Medical Humanities.
""We want to show them care and respectful management,"" he told the Clarion-Ledger.
""It would be a unique resource for Mississippi,"" Molly Zuckerman, a professor of anthropology, told the newspaper.
""It would make Mississippi a national centre on historical records relating to health in the pre-modern period, particularly those being institutionalised.""
The Insane Asylum was completed in 1855 and operated until 1935. Before then, patients with mental illnesses were often kept chained in jails and attics of homes.
According to records, of the 1,376 patients admitted between 1855 and 1877, more than one in five died.
After the US Civil War the facility expanded dramatically, eventually housing about 6,000 patients during its peak.
The first coffins were discovered by the university in 2013 while constructing a road near campus.
In 2014 officials found more than 1,000 coffins while building a parking garage.","The remains of at least 7,000 people may be buried beneath the University of Mississippi, officials estimate."
"Specialist micro-engineer Graham Short visited the Dickinson & Morris Ye Olde Pork Pie Shoppe in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, on Friday.
It follows the use of one of the special notes at a bakery in Kelso, Scotland, and also a cafe in Wales.
The final note will be spent this week in Northern Ireland.
Updates on this story and more from Leicestershire
Mr Short, from Birmingham, came up with the idea of engraving a 5mm portrait of Pride and Prejudice author Austen on the transparent part of the new plastic Bank of England £5 notes to mark the 200th anniversary of Austen's death next year.
He has included a different quote around each one, ensuring that each note is unique.
Anyone who finds one of the notes has been advised to contact the Tony Huggins-Haig Gallery, which launched the project.
The Bank of England's website states that it is illegal to deface bank notes under the Currency & Banknotes Act 1928.
In a statement, the gallery said it had contacted the Bank of England, which informed them that the notes were still legal tender.
Mr Huggins-Haig told BBC Scotland all of Mr Short's work has an insurance valuation of about £50,000. He also described the notes as like ""the Willy Wonka golden ticket"".
Mr Short's last work - a minute picture of the Queen on a pinhead - sold for £100,000.
The four notes have the following serial numbers and quotes:
Mr Short, 70, said: ""As I enjoy pork pies, I thought where better to spend the English note than in Melton Mowbray?""
Stephen Hallam, from the shop, told the BBC every £5 note is not ""inspected with a magnifying glass"", but admitted the notes in the shop were ""scrutinised"" after they were told on Monday that Mr Short had visited the shop.
However, the special note could not be found.
""I'm still here making pork pies... I'm not flying off to Barbados,"" Mr Hallam said.
Mr Short told BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad programme he chose Square Café in Blackwood High Street in Caerphilly because that was where his mother was born in 1909.

"The woman, in her early 20s, was rescued by RNLI lifeguards who were on duty for the first day of the season at Newquay's Fistral beach.
Lewis Timson, lifeguard supervisor, said the surfer's longboard leash snapped while she was competing in the Natty Surf Jam one-day event.
He described conditions at sea as ""pretty wild"".
The ""distressed"" woman, who is thought to be from Newquay, was taken ashore, but was not believed to need hospital treatment.
The festival was arranged in memory of 25-year-old local surfer Nathaniel Loney who died after battling severe depression and bi-polar disorder.

Wenger's contract is due to expire at the end of the season but he has repeatedly expressed his desire to continue in the role he has held since 1996.
Asked whether he would now sign a new deal, he said: ""That should normally happen yes, and we are in very normal circumstances. It was never a question of leaving. It was a question of doing the right job for this football club.""
James Chester and Curtis Davies put Hull two up inside eight minutes but Santi Cazorla pulled a goal back before half-time. Laurent Koscielny equalised to send the game into extra time, when Aaron Ramsey scored the winner.
Wenger, who won the FA Cup for the fifth time in his Arsenal career, said: ""It was more important today than all the others. Twice we had won the double, so we had already won something and were not under the pressure we were under here.
""It is a feeling of relief and happiness as we were under severe pressure to win and we didn't start well of course. Hull started stronger and you could see we were hesitant. We demonstrated how to respond to being 2-0 down but we also demonstrated how not to start an FA Cup final.
""It is a big moment to win and when it happens after a long time it sometimes comes with suffering so it was a great moment.""

Former manager George Graham, who led Arsenal to the league title in 1989 and 1991, said the club need to bring in ""three quality players"" if they are going to challenge for top-flight honours, including a midfield dynamo in the mould of 1998 World Cup winner Patrick Vieira.
""In midfield there's an embarrassment of riches, they're all very similar and I think they need a strong, Vieira type player who leads the team,"" the Scot told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme.
""Up front, there's no question, that's been their failing this season. They've only got one out-and-out centre-forward and they need a class forward to add to the team.""
Like Wenger, Arsenal right-back Bacary Sagna is also out of contract and has been linked with a move to Manchester City.
""I think until we start pressuring the ball much better than we're doing we'll remain vulnerable. A good team to watch, but vulnerable against the better teams.""
Asked if the Cup final was his last game for Arsenal, he said: ""I don't know to be honest, as everyone says I have been talking with the club for a long time and we will try to find a solution, but I don't know what that will be.""
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta praised his team's ""desire"" to fight back and hailed the scorer of the winning goal.
""It's unbelievable, when you go 2-0 down it is really rare to come back and win the Cup,"" he said.

"The Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) says the current proposals are ""unnecessarily complicated"".
Their report says that bans in Ireland and Wales were simpler and have significantly reduced the impact of plastic bags on the environment.
Over eight billion disposable carrier bags are used in England every year.
Last September, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced plans for a single use plastic bag charge in England that would come into effect after the 2015 election.
Mr Clegg highlighted the threat of plastic bags to marine life and the countryside. The money raised by the levy would go to charity, he said, and the time to act was now.
""This is not a new problem. We've waited too long for action. That's why I am drawing a line under the issue now. The charge will be implemented sensibly - small businesses will be exempt.""
But it is the planned exemptions and other rules that have raised the hackles of the EAC.
The proposals have been drawn up by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).
They want the 5p charge to apply only to supermarkets and larger stores. Most small shops and takeaway outlets would not have to pay the cost.
Defra says that the charge should not be a burden to small businesses.
As well as this exemption, Defra does not want the charge to apply to biodegradable bags. Paper bags and reusable ""bags for life"" will also avoid the levy.
But the EAC believe these rules are making the proposal too complex.
""Ministers have managed to make a complete mess of their planned carrier bags charge by making it unnecessarily complicated,"" said Joan Walley MP, chair of the committee.
""Carrier bags litter our streets and harm wildlife, and the government is right to want to reduce their use. But Defra seems to have made decisions about the design of this scheme that were based more on wishful thinking than hard evidence.""
The MPs' report said many trade bodies representing small retailers were opposed to the exemption as it was confusing for consumers.
The Association of Convenience Stores said the best way of tackling the issue was to ensure that every shop charged for plastic bags.
""We urge the government to listen to the recommendations of the Environmental Audit Committee and ensure that convenience stores are not left out of the carrier bag charge,"" said ACS chief executive James Lowman.
The EAC said that exempting paper bags was also misguided as it would weaken the message that consumers should recycle their plastic.
The idea that biodegradable bags should avoid the charge was also a bad idea, said the EAC, as they say they are not as green as they sound.
In evidence before the committee, Jessica Baker from the British Plastics Federation recycling group, said an exemption on biodegradable bags would be ""disastrous.""
There were also concerns that biodegradable material still presented a threat to wildlife, as it took time to decay.
A Defra spokesman defended the planned exemptions, saying: ""Paper bags make up only a small proportion of carrier bags and break down naturally. Biodegradable bags will only be exempt if they are genuinely biodegradable - currently such a bag does not exist.""
The MPs said that England should follow the example of Wales and the Irish Republic and introduce a straightforward scheme without exemptions.
The committee's concerns were echoed by the Keep Britain Tidy campaign group.
""It's a no brainer of an issue - it's quite clear. In Wales where there is a flat charge across the board, bag consumption went down by 70%,"" said Andy Walker
""Unfortunately the government is overcomplicating this, we have a perfect model in Wales that is doing the job it was brought in to do and the government should implement it.""
Friends of the Earth said the introduction of a plastic bag charge was a small step in the right direction but it was insignificant in terms of dealing with the scale of waste.
""Ministers must take urgent steps to slash waste and turn it into valuable resources, and save some of the phenomenal £650m a year we squander burying and burning reusable and recyclable materials,"" said Michael Warhurst from the group.
The government expects the charge to raise around £70m for charity, which shops will donate directly. The EAC wants the £19 million that will be raised as VAT from the charge to also go to environmental good causes.

"In a statement, Pyongyang warned that South Korea's ultimatum would ""lead to no good results"".
On Thursday, Seoul gave the North 24 hours to agree to talks on the Kaesong Industrial Complex, warning of ""grave measures"" if its offer was ignored.
South Korea's president later held a meeting with top officials to discuss next steps, Yonhap reported.
The stoppage was taking a heavy toll on South Korean firms, the agency quoted her as saying.
A statement from the Unification Ministry was expected shortly, a separate report said.
North-South tensions are high following Pyongyang's nuclear test in February and the subsequent imposition of expanded UN sanctions.
The Kaesong complex, launched in 2003 as a sign of North-South co-operation, is located just inside North Korea. It is the biggest contributor to inter-Korean trade and provides the North with much-needed hard currency.
Q&A: Kaesong Industrial Complex
Analysis: The North Korea threat
Missile defences in the region
Picking apart the bluster
But Pyongyang blocked South Korean access to the site and pulled out its 53,000 workers earlier this month, amid a series of threats and strong rhetoric from the communist state.
""Pyongyang will be the first to take tough action if the South insists on worsening the situation at the border town,"" North Korea's National Defense Commission said in a statement.
""The kind of ultimatum made by the South the day before will only lead to no good results"".
The remaining 175 South Koreans still in the complex are believed to be running out of food and medicines, because the North has refused to allow fresh supplies from the South into the industrial park.
The South Korean government has refused to spell out what measures it may take, but there is speculation that it may be considering pulling out its remaining citizens, the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul reports.
But that would leave South Korean assets open to seizure by the North Korean authorities, as happened before at a moth-balled tourism site run by the two countries, our correspondent adds.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was aware of the South's call for talks, and ""sincerely [hoped] the operation of the complex [could] return to normal as soon as possible through dialogue,"" a UN spokesman said on Thursday.",North Korea has rejected Seoul's call for talks on resuming operations at a joint industrial zone.
"The six-year strategy aims to produce 15 new cars or derivatives of existing models and lift annual sales to as much as 5,000 cars, from 1,600.
At least half of the cars will have hybrid engine technology.
McLaren Automotive, which draws on technology used by the F1 racing team, was launched just six years ago.
Mike Flewitt, McLaren Automotive's chief executive, told the BBC: ""This business plan confirms that McLaren Automotive will remain proudly and fiercely independent by continuing to build the world's finest two-seater sports and supercars.""
But he added that plan, called Track 22, was also about broadening the Uk supercar maker's customer base with a new range of cars more attractive to the rich - rather than just the super-rich.
The company is responsible for supercars including the £1m petrol-electric hybrid McLaren P1, but has already started introducing cheaper models.
This includes the launch at the Geneva Motor Show of the £150,000-plus 570GT, which is pitched at some rival cars produced by Ferrari and Porsche.
Rather than being a racing machine, Mr Flewitt says the 570GT is designed to give a more relaxed drive, and has been designed with a more comfortable suspension. It also has more luggage capacity.
""We see this [car] as being very easy to drive on a day-to-day basis,"" Mr Flewitt said.
About a quarter of the new £1bn investment will go directly into research and development, Mr Flewitt said. This will include work on an all-electric prototype. Electric sportscar technology is advancing fast, led by the likes of Tesla.
He also hopes that the new range of cars will bring down the age profile of a typical McLaren buyer, which is 40-plus in Europe. However, the typical Chinese buyer is in his or her 20s.
The Track 22 plan will involve McLaren Automotive adding about 500 staff to its existing 1,500. A second production shift has already started at the company's factory at Woking, Surrey, and a recruitment drive has begun.
Many of the jobs will be skilled engineering roles. Mr Flewitt said the market for good engineers is ""undoubtedly getting more competitive."" But he added: ""Luckily, McLaren is an attractive brand to come and work for.""
More than 90% of McLaren's output is for export, and the company has seen sales fall in China as the economy slows.
Is he worried about the health of the global economy? ""You worry about it all the time. The strategy we took was to make sure we had broad distribution.
""We sell cars into 30 markets, with 82 dealerships. As one market comes down - China has dropped this year and last year - other markets strengthen,"" he said.","McLaren Automotive, part of the F1 group, has unveiled a £1bn expansion plan to produce up to 15 new models and recruit 500 staff."

"The Gunners were extremely poor and were outplayed for long periods at home, but they still picked up a point and actually created enough chances to win the match because of the brilliance of Mesut Ozil.
I would not even say Ozil had a particularly good game but he got his side out of jail with his cross for Kieran Gibbs' equaliser.
Ozil had already provided two balls from a free-kick and a corner that Olivier Giroud should have scored from - he hit the bar with his first header and sent the second one wide.
Tottenham knew how dangerous he was because they stopped him from getting on the ball in open play until the final 15 minutes, but his magic touch was still able to rescue Arsenal from what would have been a very bad defeat.
Ozil had already made 47 chances this season going into Sunday's game, the most in the Premier League alongside West Ham's Dimitri Payet. That works out at an average of almost five a game in each of his previous 10 appearances.
In the first half at Emirates Stadium, however, the German did not even have a sniff of creating an opening in open play.
That was because, from the off, Spurs had the perfect game plan. They identified Arsenal's best two players as Ozil and Alexis Sanchez and they stopped their supply at source, pressing high to stop the Gunners from building from the back.
Any time Ozil, Sanchez or Santi Cazorla did get the ball, they had two or three men on them straight away and they took them completely out of the game. Ozil dropped deep to get the ball and could not do any damage from there.
It was only in the last 25 minutes that Ozil began to get any time in possession in the Tottenham half, and he made it count.
I think he is at his most deadly when he picks up the ball when an initial attack has been cleared. The defence pushes up and Ozil is just waiting for them to do that so he can deliver it into the space they leave behind.
I have seen it happen time and time again and it was a similar story on Sunday when he picked up the ball and spotted Gibbs's run to the far post.
It was his 10th assist of the campaign, four more than anyone else, and he set a Premier League record for making a goal in six successive games in the same season.
Some people still seem to have the perception that Ozil is lazy, or a luxury player, so it is worth highlighting again how hard he actually works.
He does more work for the Arsenal team than any other midfielder or forward bar Aaron Ramsey and covers a lot of ground right across the pitch.
I think it is easy to get the wrong idea because of his style on the ball. Someone like Alexis Sanchez looks busier because he does a lot of one-twos and plays with more urgency.
It is great to play it quick and early, either one-touch or two-touch like Sanchez often does, but there is nothing wrong with being different.
Ozil has the imagination to hold on to it a little bit longer because he knows the picture will change if the defence are anticipating a one-two or an early ball, and that might leave him some space.
So he is not lazy, either off the ball or on it. Even if he was, what he brings to the team means his team-mates would not mind.
When I was in Tottenham's midfield with Rafael van der Vaart, or a few years earlier when we had Dimitar Berbatov up front, I was prepared to work harder just to get the ball to them - Rafa would create a lot of chances every game and Berba would stick a lot away.
It was not just me. The whole team were prepared to do more work than them because, collectively, we knew those players were going to win us games.
The really brilliant thing about Spurs for most of the match was that they did not allow him into the game, and it was one of the reasons Arsenal found it so difficult to get going.
I played in 11 north London derbies for Spurs and I would have been devastated walking off the Emirates pitch with only a point on Sunday.

Tottenham completely dominated, but Arsenal were always going to get at least one chance. I always felt Spurs would need that second goal, and so it proved.
It was so close to being a complete performance from Mauricio Pochettino's side - in terms of their pressing, their aggression and their creativity it was absolutely spot on.
The only thing they were lacking was a killer instinct when they were 1-0 up and creating further chances. They need to be able to put those kinds of games to bed when they have bossed them.
Pochettino will be hugely disappointed to only draw the game but it was still a massive statement of intent by his team.
Everyone at the club will want to stay under the radar so they probably will not appreciate me saying this on Match of the Day 2, but I am certain they will finish in the top four this season.

A lot of that is down to Pochettino's training methods and his willingness to use young players. It means they have got energy and pace all over the pitch. They look as fit and strong as any team I have seen this season.
Defensively they look solid - the only worry they had earlier in the season was over Harry Kane's form, but now he is banging in the goals again.
Spurs have been getting better every week and it looks to me like they are close to the peak of their powers. They deserve to be in the top four.

"The human body is teeming with thousands of species of microbes that affect health.
A study showed that transplanting gut bacteria from obese people into mice led to the animals gaining weight, while bacteria from lean people kept them slim.
The findings were published in Science.
Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine, Missouri, took gut bacteria from pairs of twins - one obese, one thin.
The bacteria were then put into mice which had grown up in completely sterile environments and had no gut bacteria of their own.
Mice with the obese twin's bacteria became heavier and put on more fat than mice given bacteria from a lean twin - and it was not down to the amount of food being eaten.
There were differences in the number and types of bacteria species from the lean and obese twin.
Overall it seemed those from a lean twin were better at breaking down fibre into short-chain fatty acids. It meant the body was taking up more energy from the gut, but the chemicals were preventing fatty tissue from building up and increased the amount of energy being burned.
One of the researchers, Prof Jeffrey Gordon, told the BBC's Science in Action programme: ""We don't dine alone, we dine with trillions of friends - we have to consider the microbes which live in our gut.""
However, the diet was also important for creating the right conditions for the lean twin's bacteria to flourish. A bacterial obesity therapy seems unlikely to work alongside a a diet of greasy burgers.
Think you're all human? You may need to think again.
For every cell that makes up the human body there are 10 bacteria living on and in it.
This diversity of life is called the microbiome and it is no surprise that it affects our health.
There have even been some patients who have had faecal transplants in an attempt to change the nature of their gut bacteria.
Patients with C. difficile infections have an imbalance of bacteria which antibiotics sometimes fail to treat.
Some medical reports suggest that samples taken from a healthy gut and piped into the patient can cure the infection.
How big an impact adjusting the microbiome could have on our lives is still debated, but it is an exciting field of research.
Do faecal transplants have a medical role?
First census of bugs living on us
Keeping both sets of mice in the same cage kept them both lean if they were fed a low-fat, high-fibre diet. Mice are coprophagic, meaning they eat each other's droppings, and the lean twin's bacteria were passed into the mice which started with bacteria that should have made them obese.
However, a high-fat, low-fibre diet meant the mice still piled on the pounds.
A human obesity treatment is unlikely to use transplants of thousands of species of bacteria from lean people's guts as it carries the risk of also transferring infectious diseases.
Instead a search for the exact mix of bacteria which benefit weight - and the right foods to promote their growth - is more likely.
Prof Gordon said the next steps in the field would be ""trying to figure out how general these effects are, what diet ingredients may promote their beneficial activities and to look forward to a time when food and the value of food is considered in light of the microbes that live in our gut - that foods will have to be designed from the inside out as well as from the outside in.""
Commenting on the research, Prof Julian Parkhill, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said he expected a future when manipulating bacteria was a part of obesity treatment.
""There's a lot of work to do, but this is proof of concept that bacteria in the gut can modulate obesity in adults, but it is diet-dependent,"" he said.
He added that changing bacteria was a promising field for other diseases.
He told the BBC: ""It's an exciting new area, but I think we need to be careful in promoting it as a cure-all.
""It's clear in specific areas - inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, Crohn's - the microbiome is going to be important.""","Bacteria living in our guts seem to be affecting our waistlines and harnessing them could lead to new ways of shedding the pounds, US research suggests."
"A sound defensive display helped Atletico earn a 1-0 first-leg advantage over Bayern Munich in the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday.
Atletico, the 2014 Spanish champions, knocked out La Liga title rivals Barcelona in the last eight.
Allardyce said: ""'He defends too much' - that's what he'd get here.""
Bundesliga leaders Bayern dominated the second half after Saul Niguez's sublime solo goal had given the La Liga side an early lead, but Atletico's defence blunted their attack.
Allardyce, whose own methods have been labelled as dour in the past, added: ""It's an art, defending - everybody has forgotten that. It's a tactical art to be able to sense danger and block people's crosses and get your toe in without fouling them now and they are very, very good at it indeed.
""The whole team buys into it. You see Fernando Torres on the edge of his own box defending. You never saw that at Liverpool or Chelsea.
""That's how good the manager is and that's why they are successful. They are successful because they concede fewer goals than everybody else and only need one to win.
""Now, everybody can say 'well, that's not entertaining', but everybody is eulogising Simeone's tactics now. I wouldn't think they would do that in the Premier League so much.""
Atletico are only behind Barca in La Liga on head-to-head record with three games left.
Sunderland have collected three clean sheets in their last four games and the manager said extending that defensive record over the four remaining league matches was key to relegation survival.
The Black Cats - who moved out of the relegation zone last weekend but only on goal difference - play Stoke on Saturday.
""At the moment, if we keep those clean sheet ratios going in the next four games, I am convinced we will stay up,"" added the 61-year-old.","Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone would be labelled ""boring"" if he were managing in the Premier League, says Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce."
"North Korea will launch the rocket to mark the 100th birthday of its late Great Leader Kim Il-sung in April, state media reported.
The US said the launch would threaten regional security and Russia described the plan as a ""serious concern"".
The move is seen as violating UN Security Council resolutions.
A spokesman for the Korean Committee for Space Technology said that the launch would take place between 12 and 16 April.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called North Korea's announcement ""highly provocative"" and urged the country to abide by its international obligations.
""Such a missile launch would pose a threat to regional security and would also be inconsistent with North Korea's recent undertaking to refrain from long-range missile launches,"" she said in a statement.
A US state department spokesperson said it would be ""hard to imagine"" giving food aid to North Korea, as previously agreed, if Pyongyang went ahead with the rocket launch.
Neighbour South Korea said such a move would be a ""clear violation"" of UN Security Council Resolutions passed after a similar launch in 2009.
""It would be a grave provocation threatening the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and north-east Asia,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.
Japan is particularly concerned as North Korea's April 2009 rocket was launched over the country.
The country's chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, told a news conference on Friday that Japan had set up a crisis management taskforce to monitor the situation and was co-operating with the US and South Korea.
""We believe a launch would be a move to interfere with our effort toward a dialogue, and we strongly urge North Korea not to carry out a satellite launch,"" he said.
Last month, Pyongyang agreed to suspend long-range missile tests.
The agreement was part of a deal for the United States to supply 240,000 tonnes of food aid to North Korea.
It also agreed to suspend uranium enrichment and to allow back UN weapons inspectors as part of the deal.
In the launch three years ago, Pyongyang said the satellite made it into orbit and characterised it as a test of its satellite technology.
The move drew condemnation from the US and South Korea and led to the UN resolutions prohibiting the North from nuclear and ballistic missile activity.
Foreign officials said there were no indications that a satellite had reached space and that the launch was a cover for Pyongyang to test long-range missile technology.
The launch next month of a ''working satellite'', the Kwangmyongsong-3, is an opportunity for ''putting the country's technology of space use for peaceful purposes on a higher stage'', said a North Korean spokesman.
The rocket would be launched from the Solace Satellite Launching Station in Cholsan county, North Pyongan province on the country's west coast.
State media also reported that the North has already launched two experimental satellites.",The US and regional neighbours of North Korea have condemned Pyongyang's plans to launch a rocket-mounted satellite as an act of provocation.
"Investors were expected to remain cautious until the Fed announces its decision on Thursday.
The Dow Jones rose 140.1 points to 16,739.95, while the S&P 500 added 17.22 points to 1,995.31. The Nasdaq was up 28.72 points at 4,889.24.
Figures released on Wednesday showed consumer prices fell 0.1% in August.
Prices were up 0.2% from a year earlier, indicating that inflationary pressures within the US economy remain weak.
Analysts think the Fed's decision is finely-balanced, as while inflation is weak, the economy is growing and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1%.
""You can make a strong case either way for the Fed to begin raising interest rates or waiting,"" Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics, told Reuters.
""The prudent risk management approach would argue for them to hold off, but if the Fed was really data dependent there is a very strong case to raise rates on Thursday.""

"The change, introduced on 1 May, means google.ps now displays ""Palestine"" in Arabic and English under Google's logo.
Using the word Palestine is controversial for some. Israeli policy is that the borders of a Palestinian state are yet to be agreed.
In November, the UN gave Palestine the status of ""non-member observer state"".
The decision by the General Assembly was strongly opposed by Israel and the United States. Previously, Palestine only had ""observer entity"" status.
It followed an unsuccessful Palestinian bid to join the international body as a full member state in 2011 because of a lack of support in the UN Security Council.
Palestinians in general seek recognition for the state they are trying to establish and the adoption of the name Palestine.
Israel considers any formal use of the word Palestine as pre-judging the outcome of currently stalled peace talks. In much of Israel's official terminology the West Bank is referred to as Judea and Samaria.
In a statement given to the BBC on Friday, Google spokesman Nathan Tyler said: ""We're changing the name 'Palestinian Territories' to 'Palestine' across our products. We consult a number of sources and authorities when naming countries.
""In this case, we are following the lead of the UN, Icann [the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers], ISO [International Organisation for Standardisation] and other international organisations.""
The Palestinian Authority (PA) welcomed Google's decision.
""This is a step in the right direction, a timely step and one that encourages others to join in and give the right definition and name for Palestine instead of Palestinian territories,"" Dr Sabri Saidam, advisor to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, told the BBC.
""Most of the traffic that happens now happens in the virtual world and this means putting Palestine on the virtual map as well as on the geographic maps,"" he added.
Dr Saidam said that since the UN vote on 29 November, the PA had written to international companies, including Google, asking them to replace their usage of ""Palestinian Territories"" with ""Palestine"".","Internet giant Google has changed the tagline on the homepage of its Palestinian edition from ""Palestinian Territories"" to ""Palestine""."
