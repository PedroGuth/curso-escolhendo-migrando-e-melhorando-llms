The trial was told Mrs King's severe dementia had worsened in the months before her death and her husband had Alzheimer's and another mental health condition called paraphrenia which affected his ability to form judgements.
King, of Cedar Close, Walton-on-the-Naze, denied murder at an earlier hearing, but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
During the trial, the jury heard King also considered shooting his older sister Eileen, who is a resident at the care home, as well as himself.
Mr King was sentenced to six years for manslaughter, five years for firearm possession and 12 months for possessing ammunition. All three terms will be served concurrently.
The judge ordered he be treated for his mental health condition at a secure hospital unit in Northampton.
Consultant psychiatrist James Warner said paraphrenia was an older person's version of schizophrenia in which people lose contact with reality.",An 87-year-old man who shot his wife dead at a care home has been sentenced to six years in prison.
"Scottish winger Matt Williams' early touchdown caused shudders round a soaking wet Sixways.
But the home side responded with four tries, allied to 18 points from the boot of stand-off Ryan Lamb.
Flanker Sam Lewis scored a hat-trick of tries, while winger Dean Hammond also crossed the whitewash.
Lamb kicked three of his four conversion attempts, as well as two key first-half penalties - and two more late in the game.
Full-back Peter Lydon got the Exiles' other try, which he converted, along with a first-half penalty for a 10-point haul.
Scottish trailed by five points from Saturday's first leg, only for that advantage to be wiped out inside the first six minutes.
Jamie Stevenson's blindside run set up right wing Williams to score in the corner.
But that turned out to be the nearest this contest got to a Scottish gain as Warriors eventually rallied and started to tick the right boxes.
Two Lamb penalties in the space of three minutes were followed by a Sam Lewis pushover try in the left corner, from which Lamb was also successful with the conversion.
Peter Lydon did reduce the deficit at the interval to 13-8 with a penalty, but two tries in four minutes at the start of the second half killed the contest.
All Blacks winger Cooper Vuna, switched to full-back following an early injury to Ben Howard, set up Hammond, converted by Lamb before Lewis crashed over in the right corner, from which Lamb missed his first kick of the night.
Lydon converted his own try to bring it back to 25-15 on the night, before Lewis's third try, again converted by Lamb.
Lamb landed two more penalties before injury-weakened Warriors brought the biggest roar of the night with the late introduction of 17-year-old schoolboy Jamie Shillcock at scrum-half.

"Joe Lawton, 17, shot himself at his family farm in Greater Manchester two days after his arrest.
His parents, Nick and Jane Lawton, are urging the Government to change the law, which says 17 year-olds are not children in custody.
The Home Office believes current laws are adequate.
Joe was arrested when police stopped him as he drove his new car home from a party last August.
He was kept overnight at Cheadle Heath police station in Greater Manchester without his parents' knowledge because he was not classed as a child.
Two days later he took his own life, using a shotgun from the family farm. The police charge sheet was at his feet when his father found him.
Joe's parents believe they could have given him more support had they been able to see him in a police cell.
In a statement on the change.org website, Mr and Mrs Lawton said: ""He was just 17 and had made a bad decision to drive home after a party. Two days later Joe took his own life.
""We were not called when he was arrested or given the opportunity to give him the support he needed.""
They added: ""The fact that a 17-year-old is treated as an adult whilst in custody is an anomaly of British law.  Once they are charged they are then treated as children. This simply does not make sense.""
""We believe if the law had been different Joe would still be alive.""
A Home Office spokesman said: ""We believe the laws in place ensure the appropriate level of care for everyone, including 17-year-olds.""",The parents of a boy who killed himself after being arrested for drink-driving arrest are calling for 17-year-olds to be treated as children in custody.

"It said such a move would ""reduce the burden"" on passengers who could instead go to claims companies which would take a cut of any payouts.
Hundreds of flights were grounded by last Saturday's IT problems.
BA said that it had ""no desire to be obstructive"" and would fully honour its compensation obligations.
The problems, which continued throughout last weekend, disrupted the travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers around the world.
Under EU law, passengers can claim compensation from BA for travel disruption, worth up to 600 euros (Â£524).
They can also claim expenses for items such as hotels, meals and phone calls - a matter that led to a dispute with insurers during the week.
Which? said the airline sector was out of step with other service industries.
In a letter to BA chief executive Alex Cruz, Alex Neill from Which? wrote: ""You have 'profusely' apologised to passengers, many of whom have had their holidays ruined, and have 'committed' to following the rules on compensation.
""This does not go far enough and is simply not good enough. You have failed your customers once and are in grave danger of doing it again.
""By simplifying the compensation process, you have an opportunity to minimise the additional stress and inconvenience you cause your customers and ensure they are not pushed into the arms of claims management companies, who will take a large part of the money they are owed.
""British Airways can, and should, seek to automatically issue statutory compensation to all affected passengers.
""This would reduce the burden on passengers and mean they get back what they are legally entitled to quicker.
""It would also allow you to focus on dealing with the individual additional expenses incurred by affected passengers on a case-by-case basis.
""Disruptions like last weekend only highlight that it is time for all airlines to introduce measures so that, where possible, passengers are compensated automatically for delays and cancellations.""
A BA spokeswoman said: ""We sincerely apologise for the difficulties and frustration customers faced during the huge disruption across the bank holiday weekend.
""We will fully honour our EU compensation obligations and have set up a link on the home page of our website to enable customers to submit their claims as quickly and conveniently as possible.
""We have no desire to be obstructive in any way and have put additional resources into our call centres to process claims as speedily as possible.""
According to one comparison website, an estimated 70% of all airline customers who have a right to a payout do not claim.
Virgin became the first rail company to automatically compensate some train passengers if they are delayed.
Travellers using its services on the West Coast main line - and who book their tickets via the company app or website - receive automatic repayments.
Communications regulator Ofcom is also investigating the use of automatic compensation when phone or internet services fail.
At present, customers tend to go through one of two ombudsman services.","British Airways should automatically compensate thousands of customers who were caught up in disruption last weekend, says consumer group Which?"
"Recep Tayyip Erdogan said voters had chosen stability following unrest.
With almost all ballots counted, state-run Anadolu news agency said the AKP had won 49.4% of the vote, with the main opposition CHP on 25.4%.
European observers have criticised the government for stifling media freedom.
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said violence, especially in the country's south-east, had also had a significant impact on the election.
Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) went further and denounced the entire process as ""unfair"".
President Erdogan hailed the result early on Monday, saying: ""The national will manifested itself on 1 November in favour of stability.""
But he also attacked media criticism of him and called for global recognition of the election result.
""Now a party with some 50% [of the vote] in Turkey has attained power... This should be respected by the whole world, but I have not seen such maturity.""

Lira strengthens after result
Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu will now begin the process of forming a new government.
Mr Erdogan called the second general election this year after his AKP lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in 13 years in June and attempts to form a coalition failed.
The pro-Kurdish HDP crossed the 10% threshold needed to claim seats in parliament, but it got 21 fewer MPs than in June's election.
The nationalist MHP's share of the vote also declined, to 11.9%, and commentators suggested it had lost voters to the AKP.
Reported results also showed:
Clashes were reported in the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, in the south-east of Turkey, as the results were being counted. Reuters said police had fired tear gas at protesters throwing stones.
Since elections in June, a ceasefire between the Turkish army and militants from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has collapsed.
Critics have accused Mr Erdogan of renewing violence to curb support for the HDP - something the government denies.
In a statement on Monday, Ignacio Sanchez Amor, head of the OSCE observer mission, said: ""Physical attacks on party members, as well as the significant security concerns, particularly in the south-east... imposed restrictions on the ability to campaign.""
He added that pressure on journalists - including a police raid on the Koza-Ipek media group in Istanbul last week - was a major concern.
Meanwhile Andreas Gross, head of the PACE delegation, said: ""Unfortunately, the campaign for these elections was characterised by unfairness and, to a serious degree, fear.""
HDP co-chair Selahattin Demirtas said on Sunday that it had not been ""a fair or equal election"".
The party suspended campaigning after a bombing in Ankara last month killed more than 100 people. The government said the attackers were linked to the Islamic State (IS) group.
Violence has escalated in Turkey since a suicide bombing in July by suspected IS militants.
The attack near the border with Syria killed more than 30 Kurds.
Turkish newspaper front pages reflect the contrasting euphoria and gloom from government supporters and opponents at the election result.
""Ballot box revolution"" declares Sabah, echoed by Aksam's ""November revolution"".

"The England striker, 23, came through United's famed youth system but joined the Gunners for £16m on deadline day.
United brought striker Radamel Falcao on a £6m loan deal from Monaco, their sixth signing of the transfer window.

""They have probably lost the way of Manchester United a little bit,"" Phelan told BBC Sport.
""Now, rather than produce, it may be the case where they are buying in.
""Someone like a Danny Welbeck has been part of United's identity and that has been broken.
""What will happen in the future now, nobody knows but that thread has been broken now.""
Former United midfielder David Beckham said he was sad to see Welbeck leave, but is hopeful promising players will continue to be developed under new manager Louis van Gaal.
""Manchester United have always bought players in but also have had a great scouting system which Sir Alex Ferguson put in quite a few years ago, where we did create home-grown talent, and that is something we have done over the years,"" said the former England captain.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""I think Louis van Gaal is a talented manager, he is well respected and with Manchester United this is a project that will hopefully last for a few years and be a successful one.
""Hopefully we have still got young players coming through.""
For many years United had a strong core of home-grown youth players under former boss Ferguson, with the renowned 'Class  of 92' - which included Beckham, Paul Scholes and Phil and Gary Neville - coming through the ranks.
As well as Colombian Falcao, new boss Van Gaal has also brought in Angel Di Maria for a British-record £59.7m, midfielder Ander Herrera for £29m from Athletic Bilbao, left-back Luke Shaw in a £27m move from Southampton, the £16m Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon and midfielder Daley Blind from Ajax for £13.8m.
Meanwhile, United youngsters Tom Lawrence, Nick Powell and Michael Keane left on Monday, either on loan or permanently.
However, defender Tyler Blackett, a youth academy product, has played in the Premier League this season, while defender Reece James and goalkeeper Ben Amos have been included in the matchday squad.
But Phelan, who was Ferguson's assistant between 2008 and 2013, believes the big-money arrivals at Old Trafford could suggest a change of philosophy at the club.
""There is always the start of something and maybe this is the start of a new way of doing things at Manchester United and maybe that is the way football is going,"" he added.
""Is it better to look at the instant rather than the future? It is a difficult one because youth is always the future, we all have to start somewhere and you just hope that product of youth can develop in the Premier League.""
Phelan expects Arsenal to give Welbeck the chance to flourish after finding his chances limited at United.
Gunners boss Arsene Wenger already has a number of England internationals in his squad, with Jack Wilshere, Theo Walcott, Kieran Gibbs and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all first-team regulars when fit.
England squad member Calum Chambers was signed in the summer from Southampton and the defender has made three Premier League appearances this season.
""He is still only a young player and with young players you will get peaks and troughs but it is a case of Danny feeling more important in himself than he probably was over the last 12 months,"" added Phelan.
""He is in a position where he can play where he wants and I think that is why he chose Arsenal because they give him the opportunity to play in his best position, which is a striker.""","Former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan feels part of the club's ""identity has been broken"" with Danny Welbeck's departure to Arsenal."
"Thomas Scanlon, 23, attacked Jamie Bagnall with a piece of wood at a flat in Pensarn near Rhyl, Denbighshire, Mold Crown Court heard.
Scanlon, of no fixed abode but who had lived at Rhos-on-Sea, admitted wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm.
On Monday, he was jailed for four-and-a-half years.
Prosecuting barrister James Coutts said Scanlon was in a relationship with Mr Bagnall's sister. It was accepted Mr Bagnall had stolen an iPad from her, and the defendant had made a threat to ""get"" him.
The court heard that after the attack in March 2015, he posted the photograph of Mr Bagnall cowering on the floor on Facebook with a caption which read ""I am sorry, ha, ha, ha"".
Mr Bagnall, who has since moved to the Manchester area, needed surgery, had severe injuries including four deep cuts to the head and an injury to his elbow.
Owen Edwards, defending, said he appreciated that he had got himself into a huge amount of trouble.
Judge Niclas Parry told him: ""This was a revenge attack - a total over-reaction to a dispute between you and Mr Bagnall.""
A 10-year restraining order was made preventing him from contacting Mr Bagnall.",A man who attacked another man in a row over a stolen iPad and then posted a photograph of his injured victim on social media has been jailed.
